<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c018'>THAT famous English Republican, Thomas Paine—whose
political pamphlets have been admired quite
as much as his theological works have been censured—uttered
in “Common Sense,” published in 1776, while he
was serving under Washington in the Continental Army,
this striking aphorism: “Europe, and not England, is the
parent country of America.” His object was to stimulate
the patriotic pride of such American colonists—and they
were many—as were not of English birth or descent,
and to proclaim that the other great branches of the human
race, settled in America, must, of necessity, have a
vital interest in the successful issue of the War for Independence.
No other great country of the world has
a population made up of so many divers “previous nationalities,”
all combined into one gigantic political whole,
as the United States of America. Most of the notable
nations of the Old World are here represented not by
hundreds or thousands, but by millions of citizens, “racy
of the soil,” and proud to call themselves Americans. A
French patriot once said, speaking in the Chamber of
Deputies: “There is no French race. France is a grand
political entity which all true Frenchmen, of whatever
race, worship.” This fine sentiment can be even more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>logically applied to America and Americans, for both are
still in the formative period. Several centuries hence,
perhaps, a race of people distinctively American in all
respects may occupy this country, but while the great
stream of European immigration continues to flow toward
the setting sun there can not exist such a racial condition
in this Republic, except in those remote districts
in which the immigrant rarely seeks a home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most Americans have read something of the political
misfortunes of Ireland, but very many among us have not
made her history even a partial study, and have often
taken their views of it, at second hand, from sources that
could not fail to be partial and, therefore, prejudicial.
We do not need to apologize for seeking to throw more
light, in a simple yet comprehensive manner, on the history
of that beautiful island the blood of whose exiled
children flows in the veins of not less than 20,000,000 of
the American people. The Irish race owes much to
America, and America, in turn, owes much to it. Truly
has it been said of the American Irish that they were with
the Republic at its birth, guarded its infancy, rejoiced
in its growth and prosperity, and will endure with it
until the end, which comes, in the fulness of time, to even
the greatest among nations. Thomas Francis Meagher
(Mä’her or Marr)—the young Irish patriot and orator
of 1848, and afterward a famous Union general of the
Civil War—in one of the brilliant speeches he delivered in
this country, said: “When, in 1849, I was a political captive
on board an English battleship, I beheld, one bright
morning, through the porthole of my cabin, while we
were anchored in an Australian harbor, the Stars and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Stripes floating from the mast of a stately American
frigate and hailed Liberty at my prison-gate!” And this
is the sentiment of every honest immigrant who seeks the
shelter of our flag.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ireland, called poetically, because of its perennial verdure,
the Emerald Isle, lies in the Atlantic Ocean, immediately
westward of the larger island of Great Britain,
from which it is separated by, in most parts, a wide and
deep strait, varying in width from 14 miles, where
the headlands of Antrim approach the western coast of
Scotland, to about 125 miles, which is the maximum distance
from the coast of England. This strait is called,
running from north to south consecutively, the North
Channel, the Irish Sea, and St. George’s Channel. The
high shore of Scotland is always visible, in clear weather,
from the northeast coast of Ireland, and the mountains of
Wales, about 65 miles distant, may be seen, under similar
conditions, from Bray Head and other points on the Leinster
coast, but no part of England can be seen at any time
from the Irish shore. Ireland, considered geographically,
is of an irregular rhomboidal shape, by some writers compared
to an oblong shield, and is situated between Latitude
51° 26´ and 55° 21´ North, and Longitude 5° 21´
and 10° 26´ West, projecting farther into the Atlantic
Ocean, to the westward, than any other portion of European
soil. Its total area, including many small islands
close to the coast, is about 32,500 square miles, or 19,000
less than England, 2,000 more than Scotland, 25,000
more than Wales, and nearly 2,000 less than our inland
State of Indiana. Ireland would make, almost to a fraction,
thirty-two States the size of Rhode Island, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>has a Legislature of its own—a privilege the Green Isle
does not, at present, enjoy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The island is divided into four provinces—in ancient
times it had five; namely, Leinster in the east, Ulster in
the north, Connaught in the west, and Munster in the
south. These are, again, divided into two-and-thirty
counties—a system of Anglo-Norman, or English, invention,
and, according to the learned Doctor Joyce, savant
and historian, they generally represent the older native
territories and sub-kingdoms. King John, “Lord” of
Ireland, formed twelve of them in the twelfth century—Dublin,
Kildare, Meath, Uriel (or Louth), Carlow, Kilkenny,
Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and
Tipperary. Henry VIII divided Meath proper into two
counties and called one Westmeath. King’s and Queen’s
Counties were formed in the reign of Mary I, who married
Philip II of Spain, out of the old districts of Leix
and Offaly. Hence their capitals are called, respectively,
Philipstown and Maryborough. The county Longford
was formed out of the territory of Annaly, by Deputy
Sir Henry Sydney, about 1565. The same official divided
Connaught into six counties—Galway, Mayo, Sligo,
Roscommon, Leitrim, and Clare. The latter county, although
situated on the Connaught bank of the river Shannon,
was subsequently given to Munster, because it had
formed a part of that province in ancient times. Antrim
and Down were organized into counties early in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, and Lord Deputy Perrott, about
1584, formed seven others out of Ulster; namely, Armagh,
Monaghan, Tyrone, Coleraine (now Derry), Donegal,
Fermanagh, and Cavan. Dublin County, at first,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>included Wicklow, but, in 1605, during the reign of
James I, Sir Arthur Chichester made the latter a separate
county.</p>

<p class='c009'>The existing division of the counties among the provinces
is as follows: Munster comprises Clare, Cork, Kerry,
Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford; Ulster contains
Antrim, Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Down, Fermanagh,
Derry, Monaghan, and Tyrone; Connaught has Galway,
Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Sligo; Leinster comprises
Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, King’s County,
Longford, Louth, Meath, Queen’s County, Westmeath,
Wexford, and Wicklow.</p>

<p class='c009'>The reader ought to know, however, that a majority
of the Ulster and Connaught counties, and some in Leinster
and Munster, did not recognize their English designations,
or yield to English law, in any shape, until after
the accession of James I to the British throne, in 1603.
They were governed by their own princes, chiefs, and
judges, under the old Brehon law, until “the Peace of
Mellifont” in that year.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the Irish counties differ very materially in extent,
the provinces show the following proportions: Munster,
6,064,579 acres; Ulster, 5,475,458; Leinster, 4,871,118;
Connaught, 4,392,043. The island is further subdivided
into 316 baronies, 2,532 parishes, and 60,760
townlands, which average about 300 acres each. These
are figures with which every student of Irish history
should be familiar.</p>

<p class='c009'>The country is, in general, very fertile, and grows
cereals luxuriantly. The green crops, such as turnips,
parsnips, cabbages, and kindred vegetables, are unexcelled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Its grazing capacity is very great, and Irish
horses, homed cattle, sheep, and swine are among the
choicest in Europe. Apples, pears, plums, and the smaller
fruits grow abundantly in the mild, moist climate, but the
Irish sun will not ripen peaches, grapes, or tomatoes, unless
they are under glass. Poultry thrive wondrously,
and there is a large exportation of fowl and eggs to the
British markets. Irish butter ranks high also. Yet the
country is poor, chiefly because of the scarcity of manufactures,
and for other reasons that will be explained as
we proceed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish climate is equable, but, in general, damp,
when compared with that of America. Neither summer
heat nor winter cold produces discomfort, except at very
rare intervals. Violent storms are infrequent, except
along the western coast, and electrical disturbances are
much rarer than in our atmosphere. Only one cyclonic
storm, that of January 6, 1839, visited Ireland during the
nineteenth century, and it is known to this day as “the Big
Wind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Irish scenery is peculiar in character—soft, yet bold of
outline, as regards its mountain regions. The cliffs on
the Connaught, Ulster, and Munster coasts are tall and
beetling—those of Moher, in Clare, and those that flank
the Giants’ Causeway—a remarkable basaltic formation
in Antrim—being the most notable. All the elevations
that rise above a thousand feet are clothed with the
heather, which is also peculiar to Scotland, and this
plant changes its hue with every season so that
there is a constant shifting of color, which adds much
to the charm of the landscape. The Irish sky, too,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>is changeful, so much so that an Irish poet, in paying
tribute to the beauty of his wife, wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Eyes like the skies of dear Erin, our mother,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where shadow and sunshine are chasing each other!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Snow generally disappears from the summits of the Irish
mountains about the second week of May. The mildness
of the climate in a latitude so far toward the north is due
to the powerful influence of the warm Gulf Stream, and
this also explains the verdure of the country at almost
all periods of the year. A striking characteristic of the
Irish mountains is that they, in general, rise abruptly
from the plain, which gives them an appearance of greater
altitude than they really possess; the highest peak in the
island—that of Carn Tual in Kerry—being only a trifle
over 3,400 feet. There is still another peculiarity of the
Irish mountain system which strikes all tourists—the
highland chains, for the most part, rise near the coast,
and follow its course, thus making it one of the boldest
and grandest in Europe, while some detached groups,
such as the Galtee and Slieve Bloom ranges in Munster
and Leinster, the Curlews in Connaught and Slieve Snacht
(Snowy range) in Ulster, seem to be independent formations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish lakes are numerous and, in general, picturesque.
Lough Neagh (Nay) in the north, Lough Corrib
in the west, and Lough Dearg—an expanse of the Shannon—are
the largest, but the most famed for scenery
are those of Killarney in Kerry, Lough Dan in Wicklow,
and Lough Gill in Sligo. The Irish rivers are
many, and, in the main, beautiful streams. The Shannon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>is the greatest river in the realm of Great Britain and Ireland,
while the Suir, the Barrow, the Nore, the Slaney,
the Corrib, the Erne, the Foyle, the Boyne, and the Liffey
are also considerable rivers and possess enough waterpower,
were it scientifically utilized, to turn the wheels
of the world’s machinery. The Munster Blackwater,
celebrated, like its sister river, the Suir, in the charming
poetry of Edmund Spenser, is called, because of its peculiar
loveliness, “the Irish Rhine.” After a winding and
picturesque course through the south of Munster, it falls
into the ocean at Youghal—a town of which the famous
Sir Walter Raleigh, of Queen Elizabeth’s Court, was
once mayor.</p>

<p class='c009'>One-seventh of the surface of Ireland is computed to
be under bogs—semi-spongy formations, claimed by some
naturalists to be the decomposed relics of mighty forests
with which Ireland was covered in remote ages. The
aspect of these “moors,” as they are called by the British,
is dreary enough in winter, but at other periods they have
their charms; the heather and mosses with which they
are, in many places, thickly clothed, changing hue, as
on the mountains, with every season. Nearly all of these
bogs are capable of being reclaimed for agricultural uses,
but the people do not desire their reclamation, for the
reason that they furnish cheap fuel to most of the rural
districts, where there is neither coal nor timber supply.
Owing to the mildness of the climate, the cut and dried
sods of “peat,” called “turf,” which resemble brown
bricks, take the place of coal and wood, and make quite
a comfortable fire. “Stone turf,” produced by artificial
pressure, and an extra drying process, makes almost as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>hot a fire as anthracite, but is much dearer than the ordinary
article, which is softer and lighter. Indeed, the
common Irish turf would be almost useless in our fierce
winter weather. These fuel “reservoirs” can not be exhausted
for ages to come. It is claimed that, by some
mysterious process of nature, they renew themselves from
time to time, after they have been “given a rest” by the
turf-cutters. Many large bogs occupy the summits and
sides of the mountains, and seem to be of the same character
as those on the level land. Occasionally the high
morasses shift their positions, like glaciers, only with
a much quicker movement, and overwhelm, like the
avalanche, everything in their path. These are called
“the moving bogs.” The last phenomenon of the kind
occurred in the County Kerry a few years ago, when
much property was destroyed and several lives were lost.
Scientists claim that these bogs are undermined by bodies
of water, which, when flooded, lift the crust and carry
it with them, in their effort to find their natural level.
It is well known in Ireland that several small, but deep,
lakes now occupy places that were formerly covered by
these strange formations. We will devote a separate
chapter to other features of this interesting country.</p>

    <div>Further of the Characteristics and Resources of the Island—Present Form of Government</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>GOLD, silver, copper, lead, iron, and other malleable
minerals are found in Ireland. The gold is discovered
in small quantities, at least in modern times,
but the beautiful ornaments, composed of that precious
metal, and much used by the ancient Irish nobility, preserved
in the Museum of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin,
and elsewhere in Ireland and Great Britain, would
indicate that it was at one time plentiful in the island.
Silver is found in paying quantities in several districts,
and silver mines are now in operation in the northern
portion of Munster. The lead, copper, and iron deposits
have never been seriously worked, and, therefore,
it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory estimate of
their extent. Coal is found in many counties, but the
most extensive fields are in Ulster. Much light is thrown
on this subject by Kane’s “Resources of Ireland,” which
can be found, most likely, in the public libraries. It gives
most interesting statistics, but they would be far too
heavy for our more condensed narrative.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ireland possesses over seventy harbors. Fourteen are
of the first class and can shelter the very largest sea-going
vessels, whether naval or mercantile. Unhappily,
excepting those of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and Belfast,
they are comparatively little used for commerce, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>reasons that will present themselves in succeeding
chapters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although in olden times a thickly wooded country,
Ireland of to-day is rather bare of forests. There are
numerous luxuriant groves and woodlands, and many of
the highroads are bordered with stately trees. The “quick-set
hedges,” planted with thorn shrubs, give, particularly
in summer, a well-furnished appearance to the country,
except in a few rather barren districts, where stone walls,
as in portions of New England, are quite common. Irish
farms are nearly all divided and subdivided by these formidable
fences, quick-set or stone, so that, when viewed
from any considerable height, the surrounding country
looks like a huge, irregular checker-board—a much more
picturesque arrangement of the landscape than our American
barbed-wire obstructions, but at the cost of a vast
amount of good land, in the aggregate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The island contains many populous, finely built cities,
well governed under local municipal rule. Dublin, the
capital, contains, including suburbs, about 300,000 people,
and is considered a very handsome metropolis. It is
surrounded by enchanting hamlets, and the sea-bathing
resorts in the neighborhood are delightful. Belfast, the
great commercial city of Ulster, is almost as populous
as Dublin, and has many of the thrifty characteristics
of an American municipality. Cork, Waterford, Limerick,
Galway, Sligo, Londonderry, and Drogheda are
still places of much importance, although some of them
have greatly declined, both in wealth and population,
during the last century.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owing to persistent agitation, and some fierce uprisings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>which caused the imperial government to listen
to the voice of reason, the social and political conditions
of the Irish people have been somewhat improved of
late years. The Irish Church was disestablished by the
Gladstone Ministry, in 1869, and, under the leadership
of Isaac Butt, Parnell, Davitt, and other Irish patriots,
Protestant as well as Catholic, the harsh land laws have
been greatly modified, and the Irish people have a better
“hold on their soil,” and are much less subject to the
capricious will of their landlords than formerly. They
are, also, much better lodged and fed than in the last
generation, and education, of a practical kind, has become
almost universal. The national school system has
many features in common with our own, and is improving
year by year. In the higher branches of education,
Ireland is well supplied. Trinity College, Dublin, the
Alma Mater of many celebrated men, has existed since
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but, until the end of the
eighteenth century, was not open to Catholics. Maynooth
College, in Kildare, is the great Catholic ecclesiastical
seminary of Ireland, and there is also a Catholic
university in Dublin. Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, and
other cities have Catholic colleges, and there are Protestant
seats of learning in Ulster and other provinces.
Cork, Belfast, and Galway have each branch universities,
called “Queen’s Colleges,” which are conducted on
a non-sectarian basis. These are only a few of Ireland’s
educational institutions, but they serve to illustrate the
agreeable fact that a dearth of opportunity for acquiring
learning is no longer a reproach to the Irish people, or,
rather, to their English law-makers. The taxes which support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the institutions maintained by Government are paid by
Ireland into the Imperial Treasury, so that Great Britain
is not burdened by them, as many suppose. Recently,
a commission appointed by the British Parliament to inquire
into the financial relations between Great Britain
and Ireland reported back that the latter country was
overtaxed annually to the amount of $15,000,000. This
grievance, although complained of by all classes, has not
yet been redressed. Dublin, Belfast, and other leading
Irish cities possess very choice and extensive libraries.
That of Trinity College, in the first-mentioned city, is
considered one of the best in Europe, and it is particularly
rich in ancient Irish manuscripts, some of which
have been translated from the original Gaelic into English
by the late Dr. John O’Donovan, Professor Eugene
O’Curry, and other Irish savants. There are many large
circulating libraries in all the principal municipalities,
and most of the smaller towns. These are patronized,
in the main, by poor people of literary taste, who can
not afford satisfactory libraries of their own. There is
now a revival of Irish literature in Great Britain as well
as in Ireland itself. Many English and Scotch firms
have taken to printing Irish prose and poetry in the
English tongue, so that Irish authors are no longer confined,
as they were, with a few exceptions, of old, to
an insular constituency. Irish literary work of merit,
when not strongly patriotic, sells readily in Great Britain
to-day. This is due, partly, to a growing appreciation
of Irish talent among the more liberal classes of the
English people, and still more, perhaps, to the very large
Irish population that has developed itself on the soil of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“the predominant partner” within the last half of the
nineteenth century. There is a strong Chartist, or republican,
element in England friendly to the Irish claim
of legislative independence, and this element, which we
hear comparatively little of in America, for reasons it
is not necessary to discuss in this history, is growing
more powerful as time rolls by, and some day, not very
distant, perhaps, is bound to greatly modify the existing
governmental system of the British Empire, and render it
more popular.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ireland is very rich in monastic and martial ruins.
The round towers which sentinel the island are declared
by many antiquaries to antedate the Christian period,
and are supposed to have been pagan temples dedicated
to the worship of the sun, which, some historians claim,
was Ireland’s chief form of the Druidic belief.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The names of their founders have vanished in the gloom,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Like the dry branch in the fire, or the body in the tomb,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But to-day, in the ray, their shadows still they cast—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>These temples of forgotten gods, these relics of the past.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The grass-grown circular raths, or “forts,” as the peasantry
call them, varying greatly in diameter, are supposed
to be remnants of the Danish invasion, but many archæologists
place them at a much earlier date, and give them
not a Danish but a Danaan origin—the latter tribe being
claimed as among the first settlers of Ireland. The largest
“fort” or “dun” in the island is that near Downpatrick,
which is sixty feet high and three-quarters of
a mile in circumference. Much of the stately architecture
seen in the ruins of abbeys, churches, and chapels
belongs to the Anglo-Norman period, as does also the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>military architecture, which survives in such types as
the keeps of Limerick, Nenagh, and Trim; but the Celtic
type of church construction is preserved, after the
lapse of more than a thousand years, in its primitive
purity, at Glendalough in Wicklow, Clonmacnois in
King’s County, and Cong in Galway.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Three hundred years of warfare with the pagan Danes,
and five hundred with the Anglo-Normans and Anglo-Saxons,
made Ireland the Island of Ruins, as well as the
Island of Saints and Scholars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before January 1, 1801, Ireland was a distinct and
separate kingdom, having a Parliament of her own and
connected with Great Britain by what has been called
“the golden link of the crown.” How that Parliament
was, unfortunately for all concerned, abolished will appear
in its proper order. Since 1801 Ireland has been
governed by the Imperial Parliament, sitting in London,
composed of representatives from England, Scotland,
Ireland, and Wales—670 in all, of whom 103 are Irish
members. Of these latter, 82 are Nationalists, or Repealers
of the Act of Union, while 21 are Unionists, or
adherents of the present political connection. The preponderating
vote of Great Britain hopelessly overwhelms
the Irish representation, and hence the work of reform,
as far as Ireland is concerned, is slow and difficult. The
executive functions are intrusted to a Lord Lieutenant,
who is appointed by each succeeding Ministry, to represent
the monarch of Great Britain. He is assisted in his
duties by a Chief Secretary, two Under Secretaries, a
Lord Chancellor, a Lord Chief Justice, a Master of the
Rolls, a Chief Baron of the Exchequer, many less prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>officers, and a Privy Council, which comprises several
of the officials mentioned, together with the leading
supporters of the crown in the capital and throughout
the country. Some of the official members of this Council
are not natives of Ireland; and the Lord Lieutenant himself
is almost invariably an English or Scotch aristocrat
of high rank and liberal fortune. No Catholic can fill the
office of Viceroy of Ireland. The authority of the latter
is, to all intents and purposes, absolute. In seasons of
political agitation, even when there is no violence, he can
suspend the ordinary law without having recourse to Parliament.
This power has been frequently exercised even
in this generation. The Lord Lieutenant’s official residence
is Dublin Castle, but he has also a commodious
viceregal lodge in the Phœnix Park. His salary is $100,000
per annum—just twice that of our President—but,
in general, he spends much more out of his private fortune,
as he is, nearly always, chosen for his wealth as
much as for his rank. When he goes among the people,
he is, almost invariably, attended by a strong cavalry
escort and a dashing staff of aides-de-camp, glittering
in silver, steel, and gold. The military garrison of Dublin
is strong, not often under 10,000 men, and at the
Curragh Camp, about twenty miles distant, in Kildare,
there is a much larger force. Most of the large towns
are also heavily garrisoned. Thus, after an occupation,
either nominal or actual, of seven and one-third centuries,
England still finds it expedient to govern Ireland as a
military district—a sad commentary on the chronic misgovernment
of ages.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>The Original Inhabitants of Ireland</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>VAGUE poetical tradition flings a mystical veil over
the origin of the earliest inhabitants of Ireland.
The historian, McGee, who would seem to have made a
serious study of the subject, says that the first account
given by the bards and the professional story-tellers attributes
the settlement of the island to Parthalon of the
race of Japhet, who, with a number of followers, reached
it by way of the Mediterranean and Atlantic, “about
three hundred years after the Universal Deluge.” The
colonists, because of the unnatural crimes of their leader,
were, we are told, “cut off to the last man by a dreadful
pestilence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The second colony, also a creature of tradition, was
said to have been led by a chief called Nemedh from the
shores of the Black Sea across Muscovy to the Baltic,
and from that sea they made their way to the Irish
shore. In Ireland, they encountered a stronger race, said
to have been of African origin, called Formorians, with
whom they had many severe battles and were by them
finally defeated and either killed or driven from the
country, to which some of their descendants returned in
after years.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Nemedh came the Firbolgs, or Belgæ, under the
five sons of their king, Dela, who divided the island into
five parts and held it undisputedly until the Tuatha de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Danaans, said to be descended from Nemedh, and having
magical power to quell storms, invaded the island, carrying
with them the “lia fail,” or “Stone of Destiny,” from
which Ireland derived its fanciful title of “Innis fail,” or
the “Island of Destiny.” The Danaans are said to have
been of the Greek family. In any case, it is claimed, they
subdued the Belgæ and made them their serfs. They
ruled mightily, for a time, but, in turn, were compelled
to give way to a stronger tide of invasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was formed by a people who called themselves,
according to most Irish annalists, Gaels, from an ancient
ancestor; Milesians, from the appellation of their king,
who ruled in distant Spain, and Scoti, or Scots, from
Scota, the warlike mother of King Milesius. These
Milesians are said to have come into Spain from the region
of the Caucasus, and all agree that they were formidable
warriors. Tradition says that Ireland was first
discovered, as far as the Milesians were concerned, by
Ith, uncle of the Spanish king, who, while on a voyage
of exploration, sighted the island, and, attracted by its
beauty, landed, but was attacked by the Danaans and
mortally wounded. His followers carried him to his
galley, and he died at sea, but the body was brought
back to Spain. His son, Loci, who had accompanied Ith,
summoned all the Milesian family to avenge their kinsman’s
death and conquer the Promised Island of their
race. Milesius, or Miledh, had expired before Loci’s return,
but his sons, Heber the Fair, Amergin, Heber the
Brown, Colpa, Ir, and Heremon rallied to the call of
vengeance and conquest, set sail for Ireland, landed there,
and, in spite of Danaan witchcraft and Firbolgian valor,
beat down all opposition and became masters of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>beautiful island. Thomas Moore, in his immortal Irish
Melodies, thus deals with this legendary event:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They came from a land beyond the sea,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And now o’er the Western main,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Set sail in their good ships gallantly</div>
      <div class='line in3'>From the sunny land of Spain.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘Oh, where’s the isle we’ve seen in dreams,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Our destined home or grave?’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thus sang they as, by the morning’s beams,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>They swept the Atlantic wave.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And, lo, where afar o’er ocean shines</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A sparkle of radiant green,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As though in that deep lay emerald mines</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Whose light through the wave was seen.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis Innisfail! ’tis Innisfail!’</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Rings o’er the echoing sea,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While bending to heaven the warriors hail</div>
      <div class='line in3'>That home of the brave and free.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then turned they unto the Eastern wave,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Where now their Day-God’s eye</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A look of such sunny omen gave</div>
      <div class='line in3'>As lighted up sea and sky,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Nor frown was seen through sky or sea,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Nor tear on leaf or sod,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When first on their Isle of Destiny</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Our great forefathers trod.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The migration of those Celto-Iberians to Ireland is
generally placed at from 1500 to 2000 years before the
birth of Christ; but there is not much certainty about the
date; it stands wholly on tradition. On one point, at
least, a majority of Irish annalists seem to be agreed—namely,
that the Milesians were of Celtic stock and Scythian
origin, but the route they took from Scythia to Spain,
as well as the date of their exodus, remains an undetermined
question. Celtic characteristics, both mental
and physical, are still deeply stamped on the Irish people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>notwithstanding the large admixture of the blood of
other races, resulting from the numerous after invasions,
both pagan and Christian. Thomas Davis, the leading
Irish national poet of the middle of the nineteenth century,
sums up the elements that constitute the present
Irish population, truly and tersely, thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here came the brown Phœnician,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The man of trade and toil;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Here came the proud Milesian</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A-hungering for spoil;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the Firbolg, and the Kymry,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And the hard, enduring Dane,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the iron lords of Normandy,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>With the Saxons in their train.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>And, oh, it were a gallant deed</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To show before mankind,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How every race, and every creed,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Might be by love combined;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Might be combined, yet not forget</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The fountains whence they rose,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As filled by many a rivulet</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The stately Shannon flows!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And the fine verses of the Irish poet may be applied
with almost equal propriety to the cosmopolitan population
of the United States—more varied in race than
even that of Ireland. No good citizen is less of an
American simply because he scorns to forget, or to allow
his children to forget, “the fountains whence they
rose.” Anglo-Americans never forget it, nor do Franco-Americans,
or Americans of Teutonic origin; or, in fact,
Americans of any noted race. Americans of Irish birth
or origin have quite as good a right to be proud of their
cradle-land and their ancient ancestry as any other element
in this Republic; and the study of impartial Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>history by pupils of all races would do much to soften
prejudices and remove unpleasant impressions that slanderous,
partial historians have been mainly instrumental
in creating.</p>

<p class='c009'>The language—Gaelic, or Erse, as it is called in our
day—spoken by the Milesian conquerors of Ireland so
many thousand years ago, is not yet nearly extinct on
Irish soil; and it is often used by Irish emigrants in various
parts of the world. More than thirty centuries
have faded into eternity since first its soft, yet powerful,
accents were heard on Ireland’s shore, but still nearly a
million people out of four and a half millions speak it, and
hundreds of thousands have more or less knowledge of
the venerable tongue in its written form. Great efforts
have been put forth of late years to promote its propagation
throughout the island, and it is a labor of love in
which all classes, creeds, and parties in Ireland cordially
work together. It is not intended, of course, to supplant
the English language, but to render Gaelic co-equal with
it, as in Wales—a thoroughly Celtic country, in which the
native language—Kymric—has been wondrously revived
during the past and present century.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>The Religion of Ancient Ireland—Many Writers say it was Worship of the Sun, Moon, and Elements</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WE have mentioned that sun-worship was one of the
forms of ancient Irish paganism. There is much
difference of opinion on this point, and the late learned
Gaelic expert, Professor Eugene O’Curry, holds that
there is no reliable proof of either sun-worship or fire-worship
in antique Irish annals. On the other hand,
we have the excellent historian, Abbé McGeoghegan,
chaplain of the famous Franco-Irish Brigade of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, supported by other
authorities, instancing the sun as, at least, one of the objects
of Irish pagan adoration. Other writers, including
the painstaking McGee, seem to accept the startling assertion
that human victims were occasionally sacrificed
on the pagan altars. This, however, is open to doubt,
as the Irish people, however intense in their religious convictions,
have never been deliberately cruel or murderously
fanatical. We quote on these sensitive subjects—particularly
sensitive where churchmen are concerned—from
McGeoghegan and McGee, both strong, yet liberal,
Catholic historians. On page 63 of his elaborate and admirable
“History of Ireland,” McGeoghegan remarks:
“Great honors were paid to the Druids and Bards among
the Milesians, as well as to those among the Britons and
Gauls. The first, called Draoi in their language, performed
the duties of priest, philosopher, legislator, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>judge. Cæsar has given, in his Commentaries, a well-detailed
account of the order, office, jurisdiction, and
doctrine of the Druids among the Gauls. As priests,
they regulated religion and its worship; according to their
will, the objects of it were determined, and the ‘divinity’
often changed; to them, likewise, the education of youth
was intrusted. Guided by the Druids, the Milesians
generally adored Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Apollo, the sun,
moon, and wind; they had also their mountain, forest,
and river gods. These divinities were common to them
and to other nations of the world.... According to
the Annals of Ulster, cited by Ware, the antiquarian, the
usual oath of Laegore (Leary) II, King of Ireland, in
the time of St. Patrick, was by the sun and wind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>McGee, writing of the same subject, on pages 5 and 9 of
his “Popular History of Ireland,” says: “The chief officers
about the kings, in the first ages, were all filled by the
Druids or pagan priests; the Brehons, or judges, were usually
Druids, as were also the Bards, the historians of their
patrons. Then came the Physicians, the Chiefs who paid
tribute to or received annual gifts from the sovereign, the
royal Stewards, and the military leaders, or Champions....
Their religion in pagan times was what the moderns
call Druidism, but what they called it themselves we
now know not. It was probably the same religion anciently
professed by Tyre and Sidon, by Carthage and
her colonies in Spain; the same religion which the Romans
have described as existing in great part of Gaul,
and, by their accounts, we learn the awful fact that it
sanctioned, nay, demanded, human sacrifices. From the
few traces of its doctrines which Christian zeal has permitted
to survive in the old Irish language, we see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Belus or Crom, the god of fire, typified by the sun, was
its chief divinity—that two great festivals were held in
his honor on days answering to the first of May and last
of October. There were also particular gods of poets,
champions, artificers, and mariners, just as among the
Romans and Greeks. Sacred groves were dedicated to
these gods; priests and priestesses devoted their lives to
their service; the arms of the champion and the person
of the king were charmed by them; neither peace nor war
was made without their sanction; their own persons and
their pupils were held sacred; the high place at the king’s
right hand and the best fruits of the earth and the water
were theirs. Old age revered them, women worshiped
them, warriors paid court to them, youth trembled before
them, princes and chiefs regarded them as elder brethren.
So numerous were they in Erin, and so celebrated, that
the altars of Britain and Western Gaul, left desolate by
the Roman legions, were often served by hierophants
from Ireland, which, even in those pagan days, was
known to all the Druidic countries as the Sacred Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two greatest battles fought in Ireland during the
early Milesian period were that near Tralee, in Kerry,
where the Milesian queen-mother, Scota, perished, and
the conflict at Taltean, in Meath, where the three Danaan
kings, with their wives and warriors, were slain. After
these events, Heber and Heremon divided Ireland between
them, but eventually quarreled. A battle ensued,
in which Heber fell, and Heremon was thereafter, for
many years, undisputed monarch of all Ireland. A large
majority of the Celtic families of the island are descended
from the two royal brothers and bitter rivals. Their
most famous Milesian successors in pagan times were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Tuathal (Too-hal), the Legitimate, who formed the royal
province of Meath, which existed for many ages, and is
now represented, but on a much smaller scale, by the
modern counties of Meath and Westmeath. The province
itself was dismembered centuries ago, and, since
then, Ireland has had but four provincial divisions instead
of five. Tuathal is also credited with having originated
the Borumah (Boru) or “Cow Tribute,” which he imposed
on Leinster as a penalty for a crime committed
against two of his daughters by the king of that province.
This tribute was foredoomed to be a curse to
the Irish nation at large, and its forceful imposition by
successive Ard-Righs caused torrents of blood to be shed.
It was abolished toward the end of the seventh century
by the Christian king of all Ireland, Finacta II, surnamed
the Hospitable. “Conn of the Hundred Battles”
made a record as a ruler and a warrior. Cormac MacArt,
because of his great wisdom, was called the Lycurgus
of Ireland. Niall of the Nine Hostages—ancestor
of the O’Neills—was a formidable monarch, who
carried the terror of his arms far beyond the seas of
Ireland. His nephew, King Dathi (Dahy) was also a
royal rover, and, while making war in northern Italy,
was killed by a thunderbolt in an alpine pass. Dathi
was the last king of pagan Ireland, but not the last pagan
king. His successor, Leary, son of the great Niall,
received and protected St. Patrick, but never became
a Christian. After Leary’s death, no pagan monarch
sat on the Irish throne.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ancient Ireland was known by several names. The
Greeks called it Iernis and Ierni; said to have meant
“Sacred Isle”; the Romans Hibernia, the derivation and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>meaning of which are involved in doubt, and the Milesians
Innisfail, said to mean “the Island of Destiny,”
and Eire, or Erinn, now generally spelled Erin, said to
signify “the Land of the West.” Many learned writers
dispute these translations, while others support them.
Within the last six centuries, the island has been known
as Ireland, said to signify West, or Western, land, but,
as the savants differ about this translation also, we will
refrain from positive assertion.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Roman legions never trod on Irish soil, although
they conquered and occupied the neighboring island of
Britain, except on the extreme north, during four hundred
years. Why the Romans did not attempt the conquest
of the island is a mystery. That they were able
to conquer it can hardly be doubted. Strange as the
statement may seem to some, it was unfortunate for Ireland
that the Romans did not invade and subdue it.
Had they landed and prevailed, their great governing
and organizing genius would have destroyed the disintegrating
Gaelic tribal system, which ultimately proved
the curse and bane of the Irish people. They would also
have trained a nation naturally warlike in the art of
arms, in which the Romans had no superiors and few
peers. With Roman training in war and government,
the Irish would have become invincible on their own
soil, after the inevitable withdrawal of the Legions from
the island, and the Anglo-Normans, centuries afterward,
could not have achieved even their partial subjection.</p>

    <div>Advent of St. Patrick—His Wonderful Apostolic Career in Ireland—A Captive and a Swineherd for Years, he Escapes and becomes the Regenerator of the Irish Nation</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>A MAJORITY of learned historians claim that Christianity
was introduced into Ireland by Catholic
missionaries from the continent of Europe long before
the advent of the accepted national apostle, St. Patrick,
who, in his boyhood, was captured on the northern coast
of Ireland, while engaged in a predatory expedition with
the Gauls, or some other foreign adventurers. In regard
to this period of the future apostle’s career, we
are mainly guided by tradition, as the saint left no memoirs
that would throw light on his first Irish experience.
Such expeditions were not uncommon in the age in which
he lived, nor were they for ages that followed. It seems
certain that his captors offered him no bodily harm, and
he was sent to herd swine amid the hills of Down. This
inspired boy, destined to be one of the greatest among
men and the saints of God, remained a prisoner in the
hands of the pagan Irish—whom he found to be a generous,
and naturally devotional, people—for many years,
and thus acquired a thorough knowledge of their laws,
language, and character. Whether he was finally released
by them, or managed to escape, is a question of
some dispute, but it is certain that he made his way back
to Gaul—now known as France—which, according to
many accounts, was his native land, although Scotland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>claims him also, and thence proceeded to Rome, where,
having been ordained a priest, he obtained audience of
Pope Celestine, and was by him encouraged and commissioned
to convert the distant Irish nation to Christianity.
Filled with a holy zeal, Patrick repaired as rapidly
as possible to his field of labor, and, after suffering
many checks and rude repulses, at last, about the year
432, found himself back in Ulster, where he fearlessly
preached the Gospel to those among whom he had formerly
lived as a serf, with miraculous success. Afterward,
he proceeded to the royal province of Meath, and
on the storied hill of Slane, “over against” that of Tara,
where the Irish monarch, Leary, was holding court,
lighted the sacred fire in defiance of the edict of the
Druid high-priest, who worshiped the fires of Baal and
forbade all others to be kindled, and, by its quenchless
flame, flung the sacred symbol of the Cross against the
midnight skies of pagan Ireland. The pagan king summoned
the daring apostle to his presence, and asked him
concerning his sacred mission. Patrick explained it, and,
having obtained the royal consent, proceeded to preach
with an eloquence that dazzled king, princes, chiefs, and
warriors. He even captivated some of the Druid priests,
but the high-priest, who dreaded the apostle’s power of
words, would have stopped him at the outset, had not
King Leary extended to him his favor and protection,
although he himself remained a pagan to the end of his
life. The saint, having made a deep impression and converted
many of high and low degree, took to baptizing
the multitude, and tradition says that the beautiful river
Boyne was the Jordan of Ireland’s great apostle. It
was while preaching at Tara that St. Patrick’s presentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was challenged
by the Druid priests. He immediately stooped
to the emerald sod, plucked therefrom a small trefoil
plant called the shamrock—some say it was the wood
sorrel—and, holding it up before the inquisitive and interested
pagans, proved how possible it was to an infinite
Power to combine three in one and one in three. Since
that far-distant day, the shamrock has been recognized as
the premier national symbol of Ireland, although the
“sunburst” flag, emblematic of the Druidic worship, it
is presumed, precedes it in point of antiquity. The harp,
which is another of Ireland’s symbols, was adopted at a
later period, in recognition of her Bardic genius.</p>

<p class='c009'>St. Patrick, or rather Patricius, his Roman name, which
signifies a nobleman, lived and labored for many, many
years after he preached at Tara, and made many circuits
of the island, adding tribe after tribe to the great army
of his converts. So deep was the impression he made in
the country that now, after the lapse of fourteen hundred
years, which were perioded by devastating wars and fearful
religious and social persecutions, his memory is as
green and as hallowed as if he had died but yesterday.
Mountains, rivers, lakes, islands, and plains are associated
with his name, and thousands of churches, in Ireland
and throughout the world, are called after him,
while millions of Ireland’s sons are proud to answer to
the glorious name of Patrick. He died at a patriarchal
age, in the abbey of Saul, County Down, founded by himself,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 493, and the anniversary of his departure from
this life is celebrated by Irishmen of all creeds, and in
every land, on each 17th day of March, which is called,
in his honor, St. Patrick’s Day.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>It is no wonder that the Irish apostle is so well remembered
and highly honored. Since the disciples
preached by the shores of the Galilee, there has been
no such conversion of almost an entire people from one
form of belief to another. The Druid priests, with some
exceptions, struggled long and bitterly against the rising
tide of Christianity in Ireland, but, within the century
following the death of the great missionary, the Druidic
rites disappeared forever from the land, and “Green
Erin” became known thenceforth, for centuries, as the
Island of Saints. Romantic tradition attributes to St.
Patrick the miracle of driving all venomous reptiles out
of Ireland. It is certain, however, that neither snakes
nor toads exist upon her soil, although both are found
in the neighboring island of Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c009'>According to Nennius, a British writer quoted by Dr.
Geoffrey Keating, St. Patrick founded in Ireland “three
hundred and fifty-five churches, and consecrated an equal
number of bishops; and of priests, he ordained three
thousand.” “Let whomsoever may be surprised,” says
Dr. Keating, “at this great number of bishops in Ireland,
contemporary with St. Patrick, read what St. Bernard
says in his Life of St. Malachias, as to the practice in
Ireland with regard to its bishops. He there says that
‘the bishops are changed and multiplied at the will of the
metropolitan, or archbishop, so that no single diocese is
trusting to one, but almost every church has its own
proper bishop.’” After this statement of St. Bernard no
one can be astonished at the number of prelates mentioned
above, for the Church was then in its young bloom.
The number of bishops there mentioned will appear less
wonderful on reading her domestic records. In them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>we find that every deaconry in Ireland was, formerly, presided
over by a bishop. Irish annals show, also, that St.
Patrick consecrated in Ireland two archbishops, namely,
an archbishop of Armagh, as Primate of Ireland, and an
archbishop of Cashel. After the great apostle’s death,
a long and illustrious line of native Irish missionaries
took up his sacred work and completed his moral conquest
of the Irish nation. Nor did their labors terminate
with the needs of their own country. They penetrated
to the remotest corners of Britain, which it is
said they first converted to the Christian faith, and made
holy pilgrimages to the continent of Europe, founding
in every district they visited abbeys, monasteries, and universities.
Ireland herself became for a long period the
centre of knowledge and piety in insular Europe, and the
ecclesiastical seminaries at Lismore, Bangor, Armagh,
Clonmacnois, and other places attracted thousands of students,
both native and alien, to her shores. Gaelic, the
most ancient, it is claimed by many savants, of the Aryan
tongues, was the national language, and continued so to
be for more than a thousand years after the era of Patrick;
but Latin, Greek, and Hebrew formed important
parts of the collegiate curriculum, and the first-named
tongue was the ordinary means of communication with
the learned men of other countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>The art of illuminated writing on vellum was carried
to unrivaled perfection in the Irish colleges and monasteries,
and the manuscripts of this class preserved in Dublin
and London, facsimilies of which are now placed in
many American public libraries, as well as in those of
European universities, bear witness to the high state of
civilization attained by the Irish people during the peaceful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>and prosperous centuries that followed the coming of
St. Patrick and continued until the demoralizing Danish
invasion of the eighth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>The roll of the Irish saints of the early Christian period
is a large one, and contains, among others, the names of
St. Columba, or Columbkill, St. Finn Barr, St. Brendan,
the Navigator; St. Kieran, of Ossory; St. Kevin, of
Glendalough; St. Colman, of Dromore; St. Canice, of
Kilkenny; St. Jarlath, of Tuam; St. Moling, of Ferns;
St. Comgall, of Bangor; St. Carthage, of Lismore; St.
Finian, of Moville; St. Kieran, of Clonmacnois; St.
Laserian, of Leighlin; St. Fintan; St. Gall, the Apostle
of the Swiss; St. Columbanus, the Apostle of Burgundy;
St. Aidan, Apostle of Northumbria; St. Adamnan, Abbot
of Iona; St. Rumold, Apostle of Brabant; St. Feargal,
Bishop of Salzburg. These are only a few stars out
of the almost countless galaxy of the holy men of ancient
Ireland. Of her holy women, also numerous, the chief
were St. Bridget, Brighid, or Bride, of Kildare; St.
Monina, St. Ita, St. Syra, St. Dympna, and St. Samthan.
The premier female saint was, undoubtedly, St. Bridget,
which signifies, in old Gaelic, “a fiery dart.” Modern
slang often degrades the noble old name into “Biddy.”
Although thought to be a purely Irish appellation, it has
been borne by, at least, two English women of note. The
Lady Bridget Plantagenet, youngest daughter of King
Edward IV, and “Mistress,” or Miss, Bridget Cromwell,
daughter of the Lord Protector of the English Commonwealth.
Lady Plantagenet, who, in addition to being the
daughter of a monarch, was the sister of Edward V and
Elizabeth, Queen of Henry VII; the niece of Richard III
and the aunt of Henry VIII, died a nun in the convent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Dartford, England, long after the House of York had
ceased to reign. “Mistress” Cromwell became the wife
of one of her father’s ablest partisans, and lived to see the
end of the Protectorate, from which her brother, Richard,
was deposed, and the restoration of the House of Stuart
to the English throne.</p>

    <div>Ancient Laws and Government of the Irish</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>IRELAND, ages before she was Christianized, possessed
a legal code of great merit, generally called the
Brehon Laws. These remained more or less in force,
from the earliest historic period down to the days of
James I, who, because of the wars and conquests of the
armies of his predecessor, Queen Elizabeth, was the first
of the English monarchs that succeeded in thoroughly
breaking up the old system of Irish law and government.
The Brehon Laws were of Irish origin and contained
many provisions more in harmony with humanity and
wisdom than some of the boasted English enactments.
In common with many other ancient countries of Europe,
Ireland did not impose the death penalty on a homicide,
but, instead, collected an eric, or blood fine, from him
and his relatives, for the benefit of the family of the man
slain by his hand. The best and briefest work on these
interesting laws, which need more attention than they
can be given in a general history, was recently issued by
an English publishing house for the industrious author,
Lawrence Ginnell, lawyer, of the Middle Temple, London.
In writing of the ancient form of Irish monarchy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>which, as we have already noted, was elective, Mr. Ginnell
says: “The Irish always had a man, not an assembly,
at the head of the state, and the system of electing a
Tanist (heir-apparent) while the holder of the office was
living, in addition to its making for peace on the demise
of the Crown, made an interregnum of more rare occurrence
than in countries which had not provided a
Tanist in advance.” The same author divides the classes
of Irish kings thus: The lowest was the Righ-Inagh
(Ree-eena), or king of one district, the people of which
formed an organic state. Sometimes two or three of
these, nearly related and having mutual interests, did not
hesitate to combine for the public good under one king.
The next in rank was the Righ-Mor-Tuah (Ree-More-Tooa),
who ruled over a number of districts, and often
had sub-kings under him. The next class of monarch
was the Righ-Cuicidh (Ree-Cooga), a title which signified
that he had five of the preceding class within his
jurisdiction. This was the rank of a provincial king.
And, highest of all, as his title implied, was the Ard-Righ
(Ard-Ree), meaning High, or Over, King, who
had his seat of government for many ages at the national
palace and capital, established on the “royal hill of
Tara” in Meath. The king of each district owed allegiance
and tribute to the Righ-Mor-Tuah. The latter
owed allegiance and tribute to the Righ-Cuicidh; and
he, in turn, owed allegiance and tribute to the Ard-Righ.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although the ancient Irish monarchy was, except where
forceful usurpation occasionally prevailed, elective, the
candidate for the Tanistry, or heir-apparency, was required
to be of the “blood royal.” Minors were seldom
or never recognized as being eligible. At rare intervals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>one might win popular recognition by displaying a precocious
wisdom, or prowess. The ablest and bravest male
member of the reigning family was almost invariably
chosen Ard-Righ, and the provincial and district rulers
were chosen on the same principle. Meath was the High
King’s own province, and the lesser monarchs swayed
over Ulster, Munster, Leinster, and Connaught, subsidiary
to, yet in a measure independent of, the Ard-Righ, who
held his court at Tara until <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 554, when St. Ruadan,
because of sacrilege committed by the reigning monarch,
Dermid, in dragging a prisoner from the saint’s own
sanctuary and killing him, pronounced a malediction on
the royal hill and palaces. Thenceforth Tara ceased to
be the residence of the Ard-Righs of Ireland, and total
ruin speedily fell upon it. All that now remains of its
legendary splendor is comprised in the fast vanishing
mounds on which once stood the palaces, assembly halls,
and other public buildings of Ireland’s ancient monarchs.
No man or woman of Irish race can gaze unmoved on
the venerable eminence, rising proudly still above the rich
plains of Meath, which has beheld so many fast succeeding
vicissitudes of a nation’s rise, agony, and fall.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No more to chiefs and ladies bright</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The harp of Tara swells;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The chord alone which breaks at night</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Its tale of ruin tells:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thus, Freedom now so seldom wakes,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The only throb she gives</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is when some heart indignant breaks</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To show that still she lives.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The most famous and powerful of the royal families
of Ireland were the O’Neills of Ulster, who enjoyed the
High Kingship longest of all; the O’Briens of Munster,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the O’Conors of Connaught, the MacMurroughs of Leinster,
and the McLaughlins of Meath. Their descendants
are simply legion, for all the Irish clansmen were kindred
to their kings and chiefs, and assumed, as was their
blood right, their surnames when these came into fashion.
When the Irish septs, about the end of the tenth
century, by the direction of King Brian the Great,
chose their family designations, the prefix “Mac” was
taken as indicating the son, or some immediate descendant
of the monarch, prince, or chief of that particular
tribe, while that of “Ui” or “O,” as it is now
universally written in English, signified a grandson or
some more remote kinsman of the original founder of
the name. Thus, the families bearing the prefix “Mac”
generally hold that they descend from the elder lines of
the royal family, or the leading chiefs, while those who
bear the “O” descend from the younger lines. And so
it has come to be a national proverb, founded on more
than mere fancy, that every Irishman is the descendant
of a king. The Irish prefixes, however, are a genuine
certificate of nobility, if by that term is meant long descent.
An old rhyme puts the matter in homely but logical
manner thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By ‘Mac’ and ‘O’ you’ll surely know</div>
      <div class='line in3'>True Irishmen, they say;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But if they lack both ‘O’ and ‘Mac’</div>
      <div class='line in3'>No Irishmen are they.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Many families of Irish origin in this and other
countries have foolishly dropped the Celtic prefixes
from their names, and thus destroyed their best title
to respectability. They should remember that “Mac”
and “O” indicate a longer and nobler pedigree than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>either Capet, Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart, Guelph, or
Wettin—all distinguished enough in their way, but quite
modern when compared with the Gaelic patronymics.
The Scotch Highlanders, who are of the junior branch
of the Irish race, according to the most reliable historians,
use the “Mac” very generally, while the “O” is
rarely found among them. On this account, as well as
others, some of the Scottish savants have attempted to
argue that Ireland was originally peopled by immigrants
from Scotland, but this argument is fallacious on its face,
because Ireland was known to the ancients as “Scotia
Major”—greater or older Scotland; while the latter
country was designated “Scotia Minor”—smaller or
younger Scotland. The Irish and Scotch were alike called
“Scots” until long after the time of St. Patrick, and the
kindred nations were close friends and helpful allies,
from the earliest historical period down to the reign of
Edward III of England, and even later. It was in Ireland
that Robert Bruce, his brother Edward—afterward
elected and crowned king of that country—and their
few faithful retainers sought and found friends and a
refuge just before their final great victory at Bannockburn,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1314. Sir Walter Scott mentions this fact
in his graphic “Tales of a Grandfather,” and also in his
stirring poem, “The Lord of the Isles.” Keating quotes
Bede, who lived about 700 hundred years after Christ,
as saying in his “History of the Saxons,” “Hibernia is
the proper fatherland of the Scoti” (Scots). So also
Calgravius, another ancient historian, who, in writing
of St. Columba, says: “Hibernia (Ireland) was anciently
called Scotia, and from it sprang, and emigrated,
the nation of the Scoti, which inhabits the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of Albania (Scotland) that lies nearest to Great Britain
(meaning England), and that has been since called
Scotia from the fact.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Marianus Scotus, an Alban (<i>i.e.</i> Scotch) writer,”
says Keating, “bears similar testimony in writing on the
subject of St. Kilian. Here are his words: ‘Although
the part of Britannia which borders upon Anglia (England)
and stretches toward the north, is at present distinctively
called Scotia (Scotland), nevertheless, the Venerable
Bede (already quoted) shows that Hibernia was
formerly known by that name; for he informs us that the
nation of the Picti (Picts) arrived in Hibernia from
Scythia, and that they found there the nation of the
Scoti.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Serapus, in certain remarks which he makes in writing
about St. Bonifacius, is in perfect accord with the
above cited writers. He says that ‘Hibernia, likewise,
claimed Scotia as one of her names, but, however, because
a certain part of the Scotic nation emigrated from
this same Hibernia and settled in those parts of Britannia
in which the Picti were then dwelling, and was there
called the nation of the Dal-Riada, from the name of
its leader, as the Venerable Bede relates, and because
this tribe afterward drove the Picti from their homes,
and seized upon the entire northern region for themselves,
and gave it the ancient name of their own race, so that
the nation might remain undivided; in this manner has
the name of Scotia become ambiguous—one, the elder,
and proper, Scotia being in Hibernia, while the other,
the more recent, lies in the northern part of Britannia.’
From the words of the author I draw these conclusions:
(1) that the Irish were, in strict truth, the real Scoti;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>(2) that the Dal-Riada was the first race, dwelling in
Scotland, to which the name of Scoti was applied; (3)
that Ireland was the true, ancient Scotia, and that Alba
(Scotland) was the New Scotia, and also that it was the
Kinéscuit, or Tribe of Scot, that first called it Scotia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There were numerous after invasions of Alba by the
Milesian Irish, who established new colonies—the most
formidable of which was that founded by the brothers
Fergus, Andgus, and Lorne in the beginning of the sixth
century. For nearly a hundred years this colony paid
tribute to Ireland, but, in 574, the Scotch King Aedan,
who was brother to the King of Leinster, declined to
pay further tribute. A conference of the monarchs was
held—all being close kindred of the Hy-Nial race—and
St. Columba, their immortal cousin, came from his monastery
in Iona to take counsel with them. The result was
a wise and generous abrogation of the tribute by the Irish
nation, and Scotland became independent, but remained,
for long centuries, as before stated, the cordial friend and
ally of her sister country. The Scots then became paramount
in Scotia Minor, and brought under subjection
all the tribes who were hostile to the royal line, founded
by Fergus, from whom descended the Stuarts and other
monarchical houses of Great Britain. This convention
also lessened the number and power of the Bards, who
had become arrogant and exacting in their demands upon
the kings, princes, and chiefs, who feared their sarcastic
talent, and paid exorbitant levies, rather than endure
their abuse and ridicule.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the abandonment of Tara as a royal residence,
in the sixth century, the High Kings held court at Tailltenn,
now Telltown, and Tlachtga, now the Hill of Ward,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>in Meath, and at Ushnagh (Usna) in Westmeath. The
Ulster monarchs had seats at Emain, near Armagh
(Ar’-ma’) Greenan-Ely, on the hill of Ailech, in Donegal;
and at Dun-Kiltair—still a striking ruin—near
Downpatrick. The kings of Leinster had their palaces
at Naas in Kildare, Dunlavin in Wicklow, Kells in
Meath, and Dinnree, near Leighlin Bridge, in Catherlough
(Carlow). The Munster rulers held high carnival,
for ages, at Cashel of the Kings and Caher, in Tipperary;
at Bruree and Treda-na-Rhee—still a most picturesque
mound, showing the ancient Celtic method of
fortification, in Limerick; and at Kinkora, situated on
the right bank of the Shannon, in Clare. The O’Conors,
kings of Connaught, had royal residences at Rathcroaghan
(Crohan) and Ballintober—the latter founded
by “Cathal Mor of the Wine Red Hand,” in the thirteenth
century—in the present county of Roscommon;
and at Athunree, or Athenry—Anglice, “the Ford of the
Kings,” in Galway. Ballintober, according to tradition,
was the finest royal residence in all Ireland, and the remains
of Cathal Mor’s castle are still pointed out in the
vicinity of the town. It was to it Clarence Mangan alluded
in his “Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth
Century,” thus:</p>

      <div class='line'>“Then saw I thrones and circling fires,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>One of the great institutions of ancient Ireland,
vouched for by Dr. Geoffrey Keating and many other
learned historians, was the Fiann, or National Guard, of
the country, first commanded by Finn MacCumhail
(MacCool), “the Irish Cid” of pagan times. This force
was popular and lived by hunting, when not actively
engaged in warfare, to preserve internal government, or
repel foreign aggression. When so engaged, they were
quartered upon and supported by the people of the localities
in which they rendered service. Their organization
was simple, and bore much resemblance to the regimental
and company formations of the present day. Their
drill and discipline were excessively severe. Four injunctions
were laid upon every person who entered this
military order. The first was “to receive no portion
with a wife, but to choose her for good manners and
virtue.” The second was “never to offer violence to any
woman.” The third enjoined on the member “never to
give a refusal to any mortal for anything of which one
was possessed.” The fourth was “that no single warrior
of their body should ever flee before nine champions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Other stipulations were of a more drastic character.
No member of the Fiann could allow his blood, if shed,
to be avenged by any other person than himself, if he
should survive to avenge; and his father, mother, relatives,
and tribe had to renounce all claim for compensation
for his death.</p>

<p class='c009'>No member could be admitted until he became a Bard
and had mastered the Twelve Books of Poesy.</p>

<p class='c009'>No man could be allowed into the Fiann until a pit
or trench deep enough to reach to his knees had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>dug in the earth, and he had been placed therein, armed
with his shield, and holding in his hand a hazel staff of
the length of a warrior’s arm. Nine warriors, armed
with nine javelins, were then set opposite him, at the
distance of nine ridges; these had to cast their nine
weapons at him all at once, and then, if he chanced to
receive a single wound, in spite of his shield and staff,
he was not admitted to the Order.</p>

<p class='c009'>Another rule was that the candidate must run through
a wood, at full speed, with his hair plaited, and with
only the grace of a single tree between him and detailed
pursuers. If they came up with him, or wounded him,
he was rejected.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was also rejected “if his arms trembled in his
hands”; or if, in running through the wood, “a single
braid of his hair had been loosened out of its plait.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was not admitted if, in his flight, his foot had
broken a single withered branch. Neither could he pass
muster “unless he could jump over a branch of a tree
as high as his forehead, and could stoop under one as
low as his knee, through the agility of his body.” He
was rejected, also, if he failed “to pluck a thorn out of
his heel with his hand without stopping in his course.”
Each member, before being admitted to the Order, was
obliged to swear fidelity and homage to the Righ-Feinnedh
(Ree-Feena) or king of the Fenians, which is the
English translation of the title.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were also other military bodies—not forgetting
the more ancient “Red Branch Knights,” whom Moore
has immortalized in one of his finest lyrics, but the Fenians
and their redoubtable chief hold the foremost place
of fame in Irish national annals.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>It would seem that a kind of loose federal compact
existed, from time to time, between the High King and
the other monarchs, but, unfortunately, there does not
appear to have been a very strong or permanent bond
of union, and this fatal defect in the Irish Constitution
of pre-Norman times led to innumerable disputes about
succession to the Ard-Righship and endless civil wars,
which eventually wrecked the national strength and made
the country the comparatively easy prey of adventurous
and ambitious foreigners. The monarchical system was,
in itself, faulty. Where a monarchy exists at all, the succession
should be so regulated that the lineal heir, according
to primogeniture, whether a minor or not,
must succeed to the throne, except when the succession
is, for some good and sufficient reason, set aside by the
legislative body of the nation. This was done in England
in the case of Henry IV, who, with the consent
of Parliament, usurped the crown of Richard II; and
also in the case of William and Mary, who were selected
by the British Parliament of their day to supplant James
II, the father-in-law and uncle of the former and father
of the latter. The act of settlement and succession,
passed in 1701, ignored the male line of the Stuarts,
chiefly because it was Catholic, and placed the succession
to the throne, failing issue of William and Mary and
Anne, another daughter of the deposed King James, in
a younger, Protestant branch of the female line of
Stuart—the House of Hanover-Brunswick—which now
wears the British crown. But, in general, as far as the
question of monarchy is concerned, the direct system of
succession has proven most satisfactory, and has frequently
prevented confusion of title and consequent civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>war. We can recall only one highly important occasion
when it provoked that evil—the sanguinary thirty years’
feud between the kindred royal English, or, rather, Norman-French,
Houses of York and Lancaster. Even in
that case the quarrel arose from the original bad title of
Henry IV, who was far from being the lineal heir to the
throne. Our own democratic system of choosing a chief
ruler is, no doubt, best of all. We elect from the body
of the people a President whose term of office is four
years. In some respects he has more executive power
than most hereditary monarchs, but if at the end of his
official term he fails to suit a majority of the delegates
of his party to the National Convention, some other
member of it is nominated in his stead. The opposition
party also nominates a candidate, and very often succeeds
in defeating the standard-bearer of the party in
power. Sometimes there are three or more Presidential
candidates in the field, as was the case in 1860, when
Abraham Lincoln was elected. Succession to the Presidency,
therefore, is not confined to any one family, or
its branches, in a republic, and the office of President of
the United States may be competed for by any eligible
male citizen who can control his party nomination. The
example of Washington, who refused a third term, has
become an unwritten law in America, and it defeated
General Grant’s aspiration to succeed Mr. Hayes in the
Republican National Convention of 1880. In France,
under Napoleon, every French soldier was supposed to
carry a marshal’s baton in his knapsack. In the United
States, every native-born schoolboy carries the Presidential
portfolio in his satchel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Period of Danish Invasion</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE Irish people, having settled down to the Christian
form of worship, were enjoying “life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness,” building churches and colleges,
and sending out a stream of saints and scholars
to the rest of Europe, when, about the end of the
eighth century, the restless Norsemen, universally called
“Danes” in Ireland, swept down in their galleys by
thousands on the Irish coasts, and, after many fierce conflicts,
succeeded in establishing colonies at the mouths
of many of the great rivers of the island. There they
built fortified towns, from which they were able to sally
forth by sea or land to change their base of operations
and establish new conquests. Dublin at the mouth of
the Liffey, Drogheda at the mouth of the Boyne, Wexford
at the mouth of the Slaney, Waterford at the
mouth of the Suir, and Limerick at the estuary of the
Shannon, are all cities founded by the Danes, who were
natural traders and fierce warriors. They did not confine
their attentions exclusively to Ireland, but, about the
same period, conquered Saxon England, ruling completely
over it; and they established a strong colony on
the north coast of France, which is called Normandy to
this day, and from which sprang, by a combination of
Scandian with Gallic blood, the greatest race of warriors—the
Romans, perhaps, excepted—the world has known.</p>

<p class='c009'>The native Irish met their fierce invaders with dauntless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>courage, but they had been so long at peace that
they were no longer expert in the use of arms, and the
Danes were all-powerful on the seas. Those Norsemen
were pagans, and had no respect for revealed religion,
literature, works of art, architecture, or, in, short, anything
except land-grabbing and plunder. It must be remembered
that most of northern Europe, at the period
written of, was in a benighted state, and that Great Britain
itself was barely emerging from the intellectual and
spiritual gloom of the Dark Ages. The Norse invaders,
whenever successful in their enterprises against the Irish
chiefs, invariably demolished the churches and colleges,
murdered the priests, monks, and nuns—often, however,
carrying the latter into captivity—and burned many of
the priceless manuscripts, the pride and the glory of the
illustrious scholarship of ancient Ireland. In the middle
portion of the ninth century—about 840—when Nial III
was Ard-Righ of Ireland, came the fierce Dane Turgesius,
at the head of an immense fleet and army. He at once
proceeded to ravage the exposed portions of the coast,
and then forced his way inland, laying the country under
tribute of all kinds as he advanced. He made prisoners
of Irish virgins and married them, by main force, to his
barbarous chiefs. He even occupied the celebrated monastery
of Clonmacnois and its university as a headquarters,
converted the great altar into a throne, and issued
his murderous edicts from that holy spot. Clonmacnois,
translated into English, means “the Retreat of the Sons
of the Noble,” and was the Alma Mater of the princes
and nobility of Ireland. This crowning outrage, coupled
with insults offered to Irish ladies, finally aroused the
spirit of burning vengeance in the breasts of the Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>people. Tradition says that thirty handsome young men,
disguised as maidens, attended a feast given at Clonmacnois
by Turgesius and his chiefs. When the barbarians
were sated and had fallen into a drunken stupor,
the youths rose upon and slew them all. The body of
Turgesius, with a millstone tied around the neck, was
thrown into a neighboring lake. Then the nation, under
the brave Nial III, rose and drove the Norsemen back
to the seacoast, where they rallied. Another raid on the
interior of the island was attempted, but repelled. Sad
to relate, the gallant King Nial, while attempting to save
the life of a retainer who fell into the Callan River, was
himself drowned, to the great grief of all Ireland. The
name of the river in which he perished was changed to
the Ownarigh (Ownaree) or King’s River—a designation
which, after the lapse of ages, it still retains.</p>

<p class='c009'>A period of comparative repose followed. Many of
the Danes became converts to Christian doctrine, and
there was, probably, more or less of intermarriage among
the higher classes of the rival races. But the Norsemen
retained much of their old-time ferocity, and, occasionally,
the ancient struggle for supremacy was renewed,
with varying success. It is humiliating for an Irish
writer to be obliged to admit that some of the Irish
Christian princes, jealous of the incumbent Ard-Righ, did
not remain faithful to their country, and actually allied
themselves with the Danes, participating in their barbarous
acts. This explains why, for a period of about three
hundred years, in spite of repeated Irish victories, the
Norsemen were able to hold for themselves a large portion
of Ireland, especially the districts lying close to the
sea, where they had no difficulty in receiving supplies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and reinforcements from Denmark and Norway. Many
of those old Irish princes were, indeed, conscienceless
traitors, but the people, as a whole, never abandoned the
national cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>The feuds of the Munster chiefs, toward the end of
the tenth century, had the unlooked-for effect of bringing
to the front the greatest ruler and warrior produced by
ancient Ireland. Because of a series of tragedies in which
the hero himself bore no blameful part, Brian of Kinkora,
son of Kennedy and brother of Mahon, both of whom
had reigned as kings of Thomond, or North Munster,
ascended the throne of that province. Mahon, progenitor
of the southern MacMahons—from whom descended
the late President of the French Republic, Maurice
Patrice MacMahon, Marshal of France and Duke of
Magenta—was murdered by Prince Donovan, a faithless
ally. His younger brother, Brian, afterward called
Borumah or “Boru”—literally, “Brian of the Cow
Tribute”—fiercely avenged his assassination on the treacherous
Donovan, and on the Danish settlers of Limerick,
who were the confederates of that criminal in his evil
acts. Brian, young, powerful, and destitute of fear, after
disposing of Donovan, killed with his own brave hand
Ivor, the Danish prince, together with his two sons, although
these fierce pagans had taken refuge in the Christian
sanctuary on Scattery Island, in the Shannon, and
then swept the remaining conspirators, both Irish and
Danes, off the face of the earth. Prince Murrough,
Brian’s heir, then a mere boy, slew in single combat the
villanous chief, Molloy, who, as the base instrument of
Donovan and Ivor, actually killed his uncle, King Mahon.
Afterward, Brian reigned for a brief period, quietly, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>King of Thomond. He had a profound insight and
well knew that only a strong, centralized government
could unite all Ireland against the foreigners, and he designed
to be the head of such a government. He had
only one rival in fame and ability on Irish soil—the
reigning Ard-Righ, Malachy II. This monarch had
scourged the warrior Northmen in many bloody campaigns.
In one battle he slew two Danish princes, and
took from one a golden collar, and from the other a priceless
sword. The poet Moore commemorates the former
exploit in the well-known melody, “Let Erin Remember
the Days of Old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Brian of Kinkora, fiery of mood, enterprising, ambitious,
and, we fear, somewhat unscrupulous in pursuit of
sovereignty, a born general and diplomat, as either capacity
might suit his purpose, burned to possess himself
of the supreme sceptre. His ambition led, as usual under
such conditions, to acts of aggression on his part, and,
finally, to civil war between Malachy and himself. A
terrible struggle raged in Ireland for twenty years, until,
at last, Ard-Righ Malachy was forced to capitulate, and
his rival became High King of Ireland in his place. The
Danes, naturally, took advantage of the civil strife to
re-establish their sway in the island, and gained many advantages
over the Irish troops. Moved by the danger of
his country, the noble Malachy allied himself with Brian,
and, together, they marched against the Norsemen and
drove them back to their seacoast forts. But those bold
and restless spirits did not, therefore, cease to war upon
Ireland. Again and yet again they placed new armies in
the field, only to be again baffled and routed by either the
skilful Brian or the devoted Malachy.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Battle of Clontarf, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, 1014—Total Overthrow of the Danish Army and Power in Ireland</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>MANY of the princes of Leinster, more especially
the MacMurroughs (MacMurro) were generally,
in some measure, allied to the Danes, and fought with
them against their own countrymen. After several years
of warfare, a peace was, at length, patched up with the
MacMurrough, and he became a guest of King Brian at
Kinkora. In those days chess was the national game
of the Irish princes and chiefs, and while engaged in it
with the Leinster guest, Prince Murrough (Murro),
Brian’s eldest son, in a fit of anger, hurled a taunt at the
former in regard to his recent alliance with the invaders
of his country. This action was, of course, rude, and
even brutal, on the part of Prince Murrough, although
MacMurrough had been guilty of treasonable offences.
The Leinster potentate rose immediately from the table
at which they were playing, pale from rage, and, in a
loud voice, called for his horse and retainers. He was
obeyed at once and left the palace. The wise King Brian,
on learning of the quarrel and departure, sent messengers
after the King of Leinster to bring him back, but his
anger was so great that he would not listen to their representations,
so that they went back without him to Kinkora.
MacMurrough immediately re-allied himself with
the Danes, and so the flames of war were rekindled with a
vengeance. Many other princes and chiefs of Leinster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>made common cause with their king and his foreign allies.
Reinforcements for the latter poured into Ireland from
Scandinavia, from Britain, from the neighboring islands,
from every spot of earth on which an invader could be
mustered—all inflamed against Ireland, and all expecting
to wipe King Brian and his army from the Irish soil.
But Brian had his allies, too; the armies of Munster, Connaught,
part of Ulster, and most of the heroic clans of
Leinster flocked to his standard, the latter led by the ever-faithful
Malachy and his tributary chiefs. All of the
MacMurrough interest, as already stated, sided with the
Danes. A majority of the Ulster princes, jealous of
Brian’s fame and supreme power, held back from his
support, but did not join the common enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Brian was now an old man, and even his bold son,
Murrough, the primary cause of the new trouble, was
beyond middle age. The hostile armies hurried toward
Dublin, the principal Danish stronghold, and on Good
Friday morning, April 23, 1014, were face to face on the
sands of Clontarf, which slope down to Dublin Bay. We
have no correct account of the numbers engaged, but
there were, probably, not less than thirty thousand men—large
armies for those remote days—on each side. It
was a long and a terrible battle, for each army appeared
determined to conquer or die. Under King Brian commanded
Prince Murrough and his five brothers: Malachy,
Kian, Prince of Desmond, or South Munster; Davoren,
of the same province; O’Kelly, Prince of Hy-Many, East
Connaught; O’Heyne, the Prince of Dalaradia, and the
Stewards of Mar and Lennox in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Danes and their allies were commanded by Brodar,
the chief admiral of the Danish fleet; King Sitric, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Dublin;<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the Danish captains, Sigurd and Duvgall, and
the warrior Norwegian chiefs, Carlos and Anrud. The
Lord of the Orkney Islands also led a contingent, in
which Welsh and Cornish auxiliaries figured.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c023'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sitric, according to some writers, was not in the battle.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus, it will seem, the cause was one of moment, as the
fate of a country was to be decided, and the ablest captains
of Ireland and Scandinavia led the van of the respective
hosts. The struggle was long and murderous,
for the armies fought hand to hand. Brian, too feeble to
sit his war-horse and bear the weight of even his light
armor, worn out, moreover, by the long march and the
marshaling of his forces, was prevailed upon to retire to
his pavilion and rest. He placed the active command of
the Irish army in the hands of King Malachy and his son,
Prince Murrough O’Brien. The conflict lasted from daylight
until near the setting of the sun. Every leader of
note on the Danish side, except Brodar, was killed—many
by the strong hand of Prince Murrough and his brave
young son, Turlough O’Brien, after his father the person
most likely to be elected to the chief kingship of Ireland.
On the Irish side there fell Prince Murrough, his gallant
son, the Scottish chiefs of Mar and Lennox, who came,
with their power, to fight for Ireland, and many other
leaders of renown. King Brian himself, while at prayer
in his tent, which stood apart and unguarded, was killed
by Brodar, the flying Danish admiral, who was pursued
and put to death by a party of Irish soldiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>The slaughter of the minor officers and private men,
on both sides, was immense, and the little river Tolka, on
the banks of which the main battle was fought, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>choked with dead bodies and ran red with blood. But
the Danes and their allies were completely broken and
routed, and the raven of Denmark never again soared
to victory in the Irish sky. Many Danes remained in
the Irish seaport towns, but they became Irish in dress,
language, and feeling, and thousands of their descendants
are among the best of Irishmen to-day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ireland, although so signally victorious at Clontarf, sustained
what proved to be a deadly blow in the loss of her
aged king and his two immediate heirs. Brian, himself,
unwittingly opened the door of discord when he took the
crown forcibly from the Hy-Niall family, which had worn
it so long. His aim was to establish a supreme and perpetual
Dalcassian dynasty in himself and his descendants—a
wise idea for those times, but one balked by destiny.
Now all the provincial Irish monarchs aspired to the supreme
power, and this caused no end of jealousy and
intrigue. Brian, in his day of pride, had been hard on
the Ossorians, and their chief, Fitzpatrick, Prince of
Ossory, basely visited his wrath, as an ally of the Danes,
on the Dalcassian contingent of the Irish army returning
from Clontarf encumbered by their wounded. But these
dauntless warriors did not for a moment flinch. The
hale stood gallantly to their arms, and the wounded, unable
to stand upright, demanded to be tied to stakes placed
in the ground, and thus supported they fought with magnificent
desperation. The treacherous Ossorian prince
was routed, as he deserved to be, and has left behind
a name of infamy. Many noble patriots of the house of
Fitzpatrick have since arisen and passed away, but that
particular traitor ranks with Iscariot, MacMurrough,
Monteith, and Arnold in the annals of treachery. Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>that has read them has not been thrilled by the noble lines
of Moore which describe the sacrifice of the wounded
Dalcassians?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Forget not our wounded companions who stood</div>
      <div class='line in3'>In the day of distress by our side;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When the moss of the valley grew red with their blood</div>
      <div class='line in3'>They stirred not, but conquered and died!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That sun which now blesses our arms with his light,—</div>

      <div class='line in3'>To find that they fell there in vain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The glorious King Malachy, although ever in the
thickest of the battle, survived the carnage of Clontarf.
Unable to agree upon a candidate from any of the provincial
royal families because of their bitter rivalries,
the various factions, having confidence in Malachy’s wisdom
and patriotism, again elected him High King of
Ireland, the last man who held that title without dispute.
He reigned but eight years after his second elevation to
the supreme throne of his country and died at a good
old age about the middle of September, 1022, in the
odor of sanctity, and sincerely lamented by the Irish
nation, excepting a few ambitious princes who coveted
the crown his acts had glorified. In the whole range of
Irish history he was the noblest royal character, and his
name deserves to be forever honored by the nation he
sought to preserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the good king’s death, a younger son of Brian
Boru, Prince Donough (Dunna), made an attempt to be
elected Ard-Righ, and, failing in that, sought to hold
the crown by force. But the provincial monarchs refused
to recognize his claims, as he did not appear to inherit
either the military prowess or force of character of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>great father. After some futile attempts to maintain his
assumed authority, he was finally deposed by his abler
nephew, Turlough O’Brien, who occupied the throne, not
without violent opposition, for a period. Poor Donough
proceeded to Rome and presented his father’s crown and
harp to the Pope, probably because he had no other valuable
offerings to bestow. This circumstance was afterward
made use of by the Anglo-Normans to make it
appear that the presentation made by the deposed and
discredited Donough to the Pontiff carried with it the
surrender of the sovereignty of Ireland to his Holiness.
No argument could be more absurd, because, as has been
shown, the crown of Ireland was elective, not hereditary,
except with well understood limitations, which made the
blood royal a necessity in any candidate. Donough, in
any case, was never acknowledged as High King of
Ireland, and could not transfer a title he did not possess.
In fact all the Irish monarchs may be best described not
as Kings of Ireland, but Kings of the Irish. They had
no power to alienate, or transfer, the tribe lands from
the people, and held them only in trust for their voluntary
subjects. Modern Irish landlordism is founded on the
feudal, not the tribal, system. Hence its unfitness to
satisfy a people in whom lingers the heredity of the
ancient Celtic custom. King Brian, the most absolute of
all the Irish rulers, is described by some annalists as
“Emperor of the Irish.”</p>

    <div>Desolating Civil Wars Among the Irish</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>FROM the deposition of Donough O’Brien down to
the period of the Norman invasion of the island—about
a century and a half—Ireland was cursed by the
civil wars which raged interminably, because of disputes
of royal succession, between the McLoughlins of Ulster—a
branch of the Hy-Niall dynasty—and the descendants
of King Brian of Kinkora, in which the latter were finally
worsted. Then the successful family fell out with royal
O’Conors of Connaught. One of the latter, a brave and
ambitious man, called Turlough Mor, aimed at the chief
sovereignty and proved himself an able general and a
wise statesman. He reigned in splendor over Connaught,
and terrorized his enemies of Ulster and Munster by his
splendid feats of arms. He held his court at Rathcroghan,
in Roscommon, and often entertained as many as
3,000 guests on occasions of festival. His palace, fortified
after the circular Celtic fashion, dominated more
than four hundred forts, or duns, which were the strongholds
of his chiefs, in the territory of Roscommon alone;
he founded churches and was generous to the clergy and
to the poor. In spite of all this, however, he was unable
to attain to the High Kingship, and only succeeded in
paving the way to the national throne for his son and
successor, Rory, commonly called Roderick, O’Conor,
whose reign was destined to behold the Anglo-Normans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in Ireland. Dr. Joyce, in dealing with this troubled
period of Irish history, says that during the one hundred
and fifty years comprised in it, there were eight Ard-Righs
“with opposition”—that is, some one of the provinces,
perhaps more, would refuse to recognize their
jurisdiction. There was also chaos among the minor
royal families. As regarded the High King, it was not
unusual to have two of them using that title at once, as
was the case with Donal O’Loughlin, King of Ulster,
and Murtough O’Brien, King of Munster. Both these
claimants terminated their careers in monasteries. A
similar condition existed, also, between Turlough Mor
O’Conor, before mentioned, and Murtough O’Loughlin,
King of Ulster, and the strife was only ended by the
death of Turlough Mor, in 1156. His son, Roderick,
then attempted to wrest the Ard-Righship from the
Ulster monarch, but was defeated. On the death of
the latter, in 1166, Roderick, who was not opposed by
any candidate of influence, was elected High King—the
last of the title who reigned over all Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be asked, why did not the clansmen—the rank
and file of the Irish people—put a stop to the insane feuds
of their kings, princes, and chiefs? Because, we answer,
they were accustomed to the tribal system and idea.
Doubtless, they loved Ireland, in a general way, but were
much more attached to their family tribe-land, and, above
all, they adored the head of their sept and followed where
he led, asking no questions as to the ethics of his cause.
Had they been more enlightened regarding the art of government,
they might have combined against their selfish
leaders and crushed them. But the tribal curse was upon
them, and is not yet entirely lifted.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The Danes held the crown of England for about a
quarter of a century after they were driven from power
in Ireland. At last, after great difficulty, they were
driven from the throne and the saintly Edward the Confessor,
of the old Saxon line, was raised to the kingship
of England. His successor, King Harold—a brave but, we
fear, not a very wise man—is said by English historians
to have “done homage”—an evil custom of those days—to
William, Duke of Normandy, while on a visit to that
country. At all events, William claimed the crown, which
Harold, very properly, declined to surrender. William
was an able and resolute, but fierce and cruel, warrior.
He speedily organized a force of 60,000 mercenaries,
mainly French-Normans, but with thousands of real
Frenchmen among them, and, having provided himself
with an immense flotilla—a wondrous achievement in that
age of the world—succeeded in throwing his entire force
on the English coast. Harold, nothing daunted, met him
on a heath near Hastings, in Sussex, where the Saxon
army had strongly intrenched itself, and would, perhaps,
have been victorious had not it abandoned its position
to pursue the fleeing Normans, who, with their accustomed
martial skill, turned upon their disordered pursuers
and repulsed them in return. The centre of the
great conflict is marked by the ruins of Battle Abbey.
The two armies were about equal in strength and fought
the whole length of an October day before the combat
was decided. Prodigies of valor were performed, but,
at last, the brave Harold fell, and the remains of the
Saxon army fled from that fatal field. William, soon
afterward, occupied London. The Saxons made but
small show of resistance, after Hastings, and, within a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>few years, “fair England” was parceled out among William’s
Norman-French captains, who thus laid the foundation
of the baronial fabric that, with one brief interval,
has dominated England ever since. A few of the Saxon
nobles managed, somehow, to save their domains—probably
by swearing allegiance to William and marrying
their lovely daughters to his chiefs—but, as a whole, the
Saxon people became the serfs of the Norman barons,
and were scarcely recognized even as subjects, until the
long and bloody wars with France, in the thirteenth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth centuries, made them necessary, in
a military sense, to the Plantagenet kings, who employed
them chiefly as archers. Under Norman training, their
skill with the deadly long bow made them perhaps the
most formidable infantry of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Normans in England, very wisely, accommodated
themselves to the new conditions and made up their minds
to live upon and enjoy the lands they had won by the
sword. They rapidly became more English than Norman,
and after the accession of the House of Anjou
to the throne, in the person of Henry II, began to call
themselves “Englishmen.” Sir Walter Scott, in his
noble historical romance of “Ivanhoe,” draws a splendidly
vivid picture of that period.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Ireland, as we have seen, the series of distracting
civil wars, all growing out of questions of succession to
the national and provincial thrones, still progressed, and,
owing to the unceasing discord, prosperity waned, and
some historians claim that Church discipline was relaxed,
although not to any such extent as is asserted by the Norman
chroniclers. But the reigning Pontiff, hearing of
the trouble, summoned some of the leading hierarchs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the Irish Church to Rome, where they explained matters
satisfactorily.</p>

<p class='c009'>About the time that Henry II, in virtue of his descent
from the Conqueror, through his mother, daughter of
Henry I, assumed the English crown, the Papal chair was
occupied by Adrian the Fourth, whose worldly name was
Nicholas Breakspeare, an Englishman by birth, and the
only man of that nationality who ever wore the tiara. He,
too, had been informed by Norman agents of the disorders
in Ireland, where, among other things, it was
claimed that the people in general had neglected to pay to
the Papacy the slight tribute known as “Peter’s Pence.”
This circumstance, no doubt, irritated the Pontiff, and
when Henry, who had his ambitious heart set on acquiring
the sovereignty of Ireland, laid open his design, Pope
Adrian, according to credible authority, gave him a document
called a “bull,” in which, it would appear, he undertook
to “bestow” Ireland on the English king, with the
understanding that he should do his utmost to reform the
evils in Church and State said to exist in that country,
and also compel the regular payment of the Papal tribute.
All of which Henry agreed to do.</p>

    <div>The Norman-Welsh Invasion of Ireland—Their Landing in Wexford</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>POPE ADRIAN’S “gift” of Ireland to Henry II,
absurd as it may appear in this age, was not without
precedent in the Middle Ages, when the Roman
Pontiff was regarded as supreme arbiter by nearly all
of Christendom. Such “gifts” had been made before the
time of Adrian, and some afterward, but they were not
considered bona fide by the countries involved. So also
with the Irish people as a majority. They respected,
as they still respect, the Pope in his spiritual capacity,
but rightly conceived that he had no power whatever to
make a present of their country to any potentate, whether
native or alien, without their consent. An influential
minority held otherwise, with most unfortunate results,
as we shall see. Some superzealous Catholic writers
have sought to discredit the existence of the “bull”
of Adrian, but weight of evidence is against them, and,
in any case, it was “confirmed,” at Henry’s urgent request,
by Pope Alexander III. The king was engaged
in civil war with his own sons—in every way worthy of
their rapacious father—during most of his reign, for he
held under his sway Normandy, Aquitaine, and other
parts of France, which they wanted for themselves.
Thus no chance to push his long meditated Irish scheme
presented itself until about <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1168. Fifteen years
prior to that date, Dermid, or Dermot, MacMurrough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>(Mac Murro), King of Leinster, a very base and dissolute
ruler, had carried off the wife of O’Ruarc, Prince
of Breffni, while the latter was absent on a pious pilgrimage.
The lady was a willing victim, and added the
dowry she brought her husband to the treasure of her
paramour. When Breffni returned to his castle and found
that his wife had betrayed him, he was overpowered by
grief and anger, and, not having sufficient military force
himself to punish his enemy, he called on Turlough Mor
O’Conor, then titular Ard-Righ, to assist him in chastising
MacMurrough. O’Conor did so to such purpose
that, according to Irish annals, Dervorgilla, which was
the name of O’Ruarc’s wife, together with her dowry,
was restored to her husband, who, however, discarded
her, and she died penitent, it is said, forty years afterward
in the cloisters of Mellifont Abbey. But Dermid’s
evil conduct did not end with his outrage against O’Ruarc.
He entertained the most deadly animosity to the O’Conor
family on account of the punishment inflicted on him by
Turlough Mor, and when on the death in battle of Ard-Righ
Murtagh McLaughlin, Roderick, son of Turlough
Mor, claimed the national crown, MacMurrough refused
him recognition, although nearly all the other sub-kings
had acknowledged him as supreme ruler of Ireland. Incensed
at his stubbornness, King Roderick, who had with
him O’Ruarc and other princes of Connaught, marched
against Dermid, who, seeing that he was overmatched,
burned his palace of Ferns, and, taking to his galley,
crossed the Irish Sea to England and sought out King
Henry II at his Court of London. On arriving there
he was informed that the king was in Aquitaine, and
thither he at once proceeded. The politic founder of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the Plantagenet dynasty received him quite graciously
and listened complacently to his story. Henry was secretly
well pleased with the treasonable errand of his
infamous guest, which was to demand Anglo-Norman
aid against his own monarch, regardless of the after
consequences to the fortunes of his country. He enumerated
his grievances at the hands of the O’Conors, father
and son, and related how he had been the faithful ally of
the former in his long war with one of the Thomond
O’Briens. Turlough Mor, he considered, had treated him
badly for the sake of O’Ruarc, and his son, Roderick,
had been quite as hostile, forcing him to seek Henry’s
protection against further invasion of his hereditary
patrimony. The Anglo-Norman king said, in reply, that
he could not aid MacMurrough in person as he was then
engaged in a war with one or more of his own sons, but
he consented to give him commendatory letters to certain
Norman chiefs, brave but needy, who were settled in
Wales and the West of England, and had there made
powerful matrimonial alliances. The traitor gladly accepted
the letters, “did homage” to Henry, and took his
leave elated at the partial success of his unnatural mission.
Landing in Wales, he found himself within a
short time in the presence of Richard De Clare, surnamed
“Strongbow,” a brave, adventurous, and unscrupulous
Norman noble, who bore the title of Earl
of Pembroke. He also made the acquaintance of other
Norman knights—among them Robert Fitzstephen, Maurice
De Prendergast, Maurice Fitzgerald, ancestor of the
famous Geraldine houses of Kildare and Desmond; Meyler
FitzHenry and Raymond Le Gros—all tried warriors,
all in reduced circumstances, and all ready and willing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to barter their fighting blood for the fair hills and rich
valleys of Ireland. They listened eagerly while MacMurrough
unfolded his precious plot of treason and black
revenge. The daring adventurers seized upon the chance
of fortune at once, and the traitor was sent back to Ireland
to prepare his hereditary following for the friendly
reception of “the proud invaders,” his newly made allies.
Before leaving Wales he had made bargains with the
alien adventurers which were disgraceful to him as a
native-born Irishman. In a word, he had, by usurped
authority, mortgaged certain tracts of the land of Leinster
for the mercenary aid of the Anglo-Normans, or, to be
more historically exact, the Norman-Welsh.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soon after the departure of Dermid for Ireland, Robert
Fitzstephen, the readiest of the warlike plotters, and the
first of the invaders, sailed for that country at the head
of thirty knights, sixty men in armor, and three hundred
light-armed archers. In the fragrant ides of May, 1169,
they landed on the Wexford coast, near Bannow, and
thus, inconsequentially, began the Norman invasion of
Ireland. De Prendergast arrived the following day with
about the same number of fighting men. Only a few
years ago, in removing some débris—the accumulation
of ages—near Bannow, the laborers found the traces of
the Norman camp-fires of 1169 almost perfectly preserved.
The two adventurers sent tidings of their arrival
to MacMurrough without delay, and he marched at once,
with a powerful force of his own retainers to join them.
All three, having united their contingents, marched upon
the city of Wexford, many of whose inhabitants were
lineal descendants of the Danes. They made a gallant
defence, but were finally outmanœuvred, overpowered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and compelled to capitulate. Other towns of less importance
submitted under protest to superior force. Indeed
there seemed to be a total lack of military foresight
and preparedness in all that section of Ireland in 1169.
Fitzpatrick, Prince of Ossory, descended from that ally
of the Danes who attacked the Dalcassians returning
from Clontarf, alone opposed to the invaders a brave
and even formidable front. He committed the mistake
of accepting a pitched battle with MacMurrough and his
allies, and was totally defeated. King Roderick O’Conor,
hearing of the invasion, summoned the Irish military
bodies to meet him at Tara. Most of them responded,
but the Prince of Ulidia, MacDunlevy, took offence at
some remark made by a Connaught prince, and, in consequence,
most of the Ulster forces withdrew from the
Ard-Righ. King Roderick, with the troops that remained,
marched to attack MacMurrough at his favorite
stronghold of Ferns, where he lay with the Normans,
or a part of them, expecting a vigorous siege. Instead
of assaulting the enemy’s lines at once, when his superior
numbers would, most likely, have made an end of the
traitor and his Norman allies, O’Conor weakly consented
to a parley with Dermid, who was a most thorough diplomat.
The Ard-Righ consented, further, to a treaty
with MacMurrough, who, of course, designed to break
it as soon as the main body of the Normans, under
Strongbow in person, should arrive from Wales. He did
not, nevertheless, hesitate to bind himself by a secret
clause of the treaty with the king to receive no more
foreigners into his army, and even gave one of his sons
as a hostage to guarantee the same. The Ard-Righ retired
from Ferns satisfied that the trouble was ended.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The royal army was scarcely out of sight of the place
when MacMurrough learned that Maurice Fitzgerald,
at the head of a strong party of Normans, had also arrived
on the Wexford coast. He now thought himself
strong enough to lay claim to the High Kingship and
negotiated with the Danes of Dublin for recognition in
that capacity. Meanwhile, still another Norman contingent
under Raymond Le Gros landed at the estuary
of Waterford, on the Wexford side thereof, and occupied
Dundonolf Rock, where they intrenched themselves
and eagerly awaited the coming of Strongbow
with the main body of the Norman army.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time Henry II began to grow jealous of the
success of his vassals in Ireland. He wanted to conquer
the country for himself, and, therefore, sent orders to
Strongbow not to sail. But that hardy soldier paid no
attention to Henry’s belated command, and sailed with
a powerful fleet and army from Milford Haven, in Wales,
arriving in Waterford Harbor on August 23, 1171. The
Normans, under Raymond Le Gros, joined him without
loss of time, and the combined forces attacked the old
Danish city. The Danes and native Irish made common
cause against the new enemy and a desperate and bloody
conflict occurred. The Normans were several times repulsed,
with great loss, but, better armed and led than
their brave opponents, they returned to the breach again
and yet again. At last they gained entrance into the city,
which they set on fire. An awful massacre ensued. Three
hundred of the leading defenders were made prisoners,
their limbs broken and their maimed bodies flung into
the harbor. King MacMurrough, who had already
pledged his daughter’s hand to Strongbow—a man old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>enough to have been her father—arrived just after the
city fell. In order to celebrate the event with due pomp
and circumstance, he caused the Princess Eva to be married
to the Norman baron in the great cathedral, while
the rest of the city was burning, and the blood of the
victims of the assault still smoked amid the ruins! An
ominous and fatal marriage it proved to Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now, at last, the blood of the native Irish was
stirred to its depths and they began, when somewhat late,
to realize the danger to their liberty and independence.
In those far-off days, when there were no railroads, no
electric wires, no good roads or rapid means of communication
of any kind, and when newspapers were unknown,
information, as a matter of course, traveled slowly
even in a small country, like Ireland. The woods were
dense, the morasses fathomless, and, in short, the invaders
had made their foothold firm in the east and
south portions of the island before the great majority of
the Celtic-Irish comprehended that they were in process
of being subjugated by bold and formidable aliens. There
had existed in Ireland from very ancient times five main
roads, all proceeding from the hill of Tara to the different
sections of the country. That called “Dala” ran
through Ossory into the province of Munster. The road
called “Assail” passed on toward the Shannon through
Mullingar. The highway from Tara to Galway followed
the esker, or small hill range, as it does in our own day,
and was called “Slighe Mor,” or great road; the road
leading from Tara to Dublin, Bray, and along the Wicklow
and Wexford coasts was called “Cullin”; the highway
leading into Ulster ran, probably, through Tredagh, or
Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, and Armagh, but this is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>positive. As it was the route followed by the English
in most of their Ulster wars, it is quite probable that they
picked out a well-beaten path, so as to avoid the expense
and labor of making a new causeway. McGee tells us
that there were also many cross-roads, known by local
names, and of these the Four Masters, at different dates,
mentioned no less than forty. These roads were kept in
repair, under legal enactment, and the main highways
were required to be of sufficient width to allow of the
passage of two chariots all along their course. We are
further informed that the principal roads were required
by law to be repaired at seasons of games and fairs, and
in time of war. At their best, to judge by the ancient
chroniclers, most of them would be considered little better
than “trails” through the mountains, moors, and forests
in these times.</p>

<p class='c009'>MacMurrough and Strongbow did not allow the grass
to sprout under their feet before marching in great force
on Dublin. King Roderick, leading a large but ill-trained
army, attempted to head them off, but was outgeneraled,
and the enemy soon appeared before the walls of Leinster’s
stronghold. Its Dano-Celtic inhabitants, cowed by
the doleful news from Waterford, tried to parley; but
Strongbow’s lieutenants, De Cogan and Le Gros, eager
for carnage and rich plunder, surprised the city, and the
horrors of Waterford were, in a measure, repeated. The
Danish prince, Osculph, and most of his chief men escaped
in their ships, but the Normans captured Dublin,
and the English, except for a brief period in the reign of
James II, have held it from that sad day, in October,
1171, to this.</p>

<p class='c009'>Roderick O’Conor, that weak but well-meaning prince
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and bad general, retired into Connaught and sent word
to MacMurrough to return to his allegiance, if he wished
to save the life of his son, held as a hostage. The brutal
and inhuman traitor refused, and King Roderick, although
humane almost to a fault, had the unfortunate
young man decapitated. This was poor compensation for
the loss of Waterford and Dublin. Those pages of Irish
history are all besmeared with slaughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of the Irish chroniclers, who are otherwise severe
on Norman duplicity, relate a story of chivalry,
worthy of any age and people, in connection with Maurice
de Prendergast and the Prince of Ossory. Strongbow
had deputed the former to invite the latter to a
conference. The Irish prince accepted. While the conference
was in progress, De Prendergast learned that
treachery was intended toward his guest. He immediately
rushed into Strongbow’s presence and swore on
the hilt of his sword, which was a cross, that no man
there that day should lay hands on the Prince of Ossory.
The latter was allowed to retire unmolested, and Prendergast
and his followers escorted him in safety to his
own country. De Prendergast has been known ever
since in Irish annals as “the Faithful Norman,” and his
fidelity has made him the theme of many a bardic song
and romantic tale.</p>

    <div>Superior Armament of the Normans—Arrival of Henry II</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>ALTHOUGH two of the chief Irish cities had fallen
to the invaders, the struggle was not entirely abandoned
by the Irish nation. Ulster and most of Connaught
remained intact, and even in Munster and Leinster
there was, from time to time, considerable, although
desultory, resistance to the Anglo-Normans. The latter,
clad in steel armor from head to foot, and possessing
formidable weapons, had a great advantage over the
cloth-clad Irish, although, of course, the latter greatly
outnumbered them. The weapons of the Irish were the
skian, or short-sword—resembling the Cuban machete—the
javelin, and the battle-axe—the latter a terrible arm
at close quarters; but even the axe could not cope with
the ponderous Norman sword and the death-dealing long
bow, with its cloth-yard shaft. In discipline and tactics,
also, the Irish were overmatched. In short, they were
inferior to their enemies in everything but numbers and
courage. But all would have been redeemed had they
but united against the common foe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Why they did not may be justly, as we think, attributed
to the tribal system which taught the clans and tribes
to be loyal to their particular chiefs rather than to their
country as a whole; the absence of a fully recognized
federal head, and the vacillations of an honest and patriotic
Ard-Righ, who, noble and amiable of character, as
he undoubtedly was, proved himself to be a bungling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>diplomat and an indifferent general. Had his able and
determined father, Turlough Mor, been on the Irish
throne, and in the vigor of his life, when Strongbow
landed, he would have made short work of the Norman
filibusters. The king seemed ever behind time in his
efforts to stem the tide of invasion. He had rallied still
another army, and gained some advantages, when he was
confronted by a new enemy in the person of Henry II.
This king, determined not to be outdone by his vassals,
had ordered Strongbow, who, because of his marriage
with Eva MacMurrough, had assumed the lordship of
Leinster, to return with all his chief captains to England,
the penalty of refusal being fixed at outlawry. Strongbow
attempted to placate the wrathful king and sent to
him agents to explain his position, but the fierce and
crafty Plantagenet was not a man to be hoodwinked. He
collected a powerful fleet and army, set sail from England,
in October, 1171, and, toward the end of that month,
landed in state at Waterford, where Strongbow received
him with all honor and did homage as a vassal. This was
the beginning of Ireland’s actual subjugation, for had
the original Norman invaders refused to acknowledge
Henry’s sovereignty, and, uniting with the natives,
kept Ireland for themselves, they would eventually,
as in England, have become a component and formidable
part of the nation, and proved a boon, instead of a curse,
to the distracted country. The landing of Henry put an
end to such a hope, and with his advent began that dependency
on the English crown which has been so fatal
to the liberty, the happiness, and the prosperity of “the
most unfortunate of nations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry having “graciously” received the submission of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Strongbow and his confederates, proceeded, at once—for
he was a monarch of great energy—to make a “royal
progress” through the partially subdued portions of Munster
and Leinster. He took care, in doing this, to show
Pope Adrian’s mischievous “bull” to the Irish prelates
and princes, some of whom, to their discredit be it confessed,
bowed slavishly to the ill-considered mandate of
the Pontiff. Many of the princes were even base enough
to give Henry “the kiss of peace,” when, instead, they
should have rushed to arms to defend the honor and independence
of their country. The prelates, trained to ecclesiastical
docility, disgusted with the everlasting civil
contentions of the country, and fearful of further unavailing
bloodshed, had some feeble excuse for their ill-timed
acquiescence, but what are we to say of those
wretched Irish princes who so weakly and wickedly betrayed
their nation to the foreign usurper? They were
by no means ignorant men, as times went, but they were
ambitious, vain, and jealous of the half-acknowledged
authority of High King Roderick, who, poor man, seems
to have been the Henry VI of Ireland. Those treasonable
princes deserve enduring infamy, and foremost among
them were Dermid McCarthy, King of Desmond, and
Donald O’Brien, King of Thomond. Both lived to regret
most bitterly their cowardice and treason.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry II was a politic monarch. He flattered the pliable
Irish bishops and spoke to them gently about Church
reforms, while he palavered the despicable Irish princes,
and, at the same time, pretended to favor the common
people and affected to check the rapacity of his Norman
subjects. Hostilities ceased for a time, except on the
borders of Leinster and Connaught, where King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Roderick, deserted by many of his allies, and deeply depressed
at the absence of national union against the invaders,
kept up an unavailing resistance. In this he was
encouraged and aided by the patriotic Archbishop of Dublin,
St. Lorcan O’Tuhill, who appears to have been the
only man among the entire Irish hierarchy who comprehended
the iron grip the Normans had on the throat of
Ireland. Had all the prelates been like St. Lorcan, and
preached a war of extermination against the invaders at
the outset, Ireland could, undoubtedly, have thrown off
the yoke, because the princes would have been forced by
their people, over whom the bishops had great moral
sway, to heal their feuds and make common cause for
their country. King Roderick, despite his errors, deserves
honor for his patriotic spirit. The Ulster princes,
too, with few exceptions, stood out manfully against
the foreigner, and a long period elapsed before the
Anglo-Norman power found a secure footing amid the
rugged glens and dense forests of the western and northern
portions of the invaded island.</p>

<p class='c009'>Geraldus Cambrensis, or Gerald Barry, a Norman
priest of Welsh birth, accompanied, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1185, King
Henry’s son, John, as chronicler, to Ireland. Like
nearly every man of his race, he hated the native
Irish, but, occasionally, as if by accident, spoke well of
some of them. In general, however, his book is a gross
libel on the Irish Church and the Irish people. He purports
to give Roderick O’Conor’s address to his army
on the eve of battle with the Anglo-Normans, and the
concluding words of the speech are alleged to have been
as follows: “Let us then,” said the Irish king, “following
the example of the Franks, and fighting bravely for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>our country, rush against our enemies, and as these foreigners
have come over few in numbers, let us crush them
by a general attack. Fire, while it only sparkles, may be
speedily quenched, but when it has burst into a flame,
being fed with fresh materials, its power increases with
the bulk, and it can not be easily extinguished. It is
always best to meet difficulties half way, and check the
first approaches of disease, for (the Latin quotation of
the king is here translated)</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Too late is medicine, after long delay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To stop the lingering course of slow decay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Wherefore, defending our country and liberty, and acquiring
for ourselves eternal renown, let us, by a resolute
attack, and the extermination of our enemies, though
they are but few in number, strike terror into the many,
and, by their defeat, evermore deter foreign nations from
such nefarious attempts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry’s astute policy disarmed, for a time, even Roderick
himself. The Anglo-Norman monarch, who would
have made an admirable modern politician, does not seem
to have desired the absolute ruin of the Irish nation, but
his greedy Norman captains were of a different mind, and
when Henry, after having wined and dined the Irish
princes to their hearts’ content, in Dublin and other
cities, at last returned to England, in the fall of 1173, the
Norman leaders showed their teeth to the Irish people,
and forced most of those who had submitted into fierce
revolt. As a result, the Norman forces were crushed
in the field. Strongbow, himself, was shut up in Waterford,
and his comrades were similarly placed in Dublin,
Drogheda, and Wexford. Henry, incensed at this unlooked-for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>sequel to his Irish pilgrimage, sent over a
commission to inquire into the facts. The result was
that an Irish delegation went to London to explain, and,
at Windsor, where Henry held his court, a treaty was
entered into, finally, between King Roderick and himself,
by which the former acknowledged Henry as “suzerain,”
and Roderick was recognized as High King of
Ireland, except the portions thereof held by the Normans
under Henry. This was a sad ending of Roderick’s heroic
beginning. As usual with English monarchs, when
dealing with the Irish people, Henry, urged by his greedy
dependants in Ireland, soon found means to grossly violate
the Treaty of Windsor, as the compact between the
representatives of Roderick and himself was called, thus
vitiating it forever and absolving the Irish nation from
observing any of its provisions. Another fierce rebellion
followed, in which the southern and western Irish—the
Anglo-Normans having now grown more numerous and
powerful—were remorselessly crushed. Roderick’s rascally
son, Prince Murrough O’Conor, who thought his
father should be satisfied with the titular High Kingship,
and that he himself should be King of Connaught, rose
in revolt and attempted to seize the provincial crown.
The Connacians, indignant at his baseness, stood by the
old king. Murrough was defeated and received condign
punishment. This bad prince must have been familiar
with the unseemly course pursued by the sons of Henry
II in Normandy, for he allied himself with his country’s,
and his father’s, enemies, the Anglo-Normans, under the
treacherous De Cogan, and this act, more even than his
filial impiety, inflamed the minds of his countrymen
against the unnatural miscreant. King Roderick, unhappy man,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>whose pride was mortally wounded, and
whose paternal heart, tender and manly, was wrung with
sorrow at the crime of his son and its punishment—decreed
by the Clans and not by himself—disgusted, besides,
with the hopeless condition of Irish affairs, made
up his mind to retire from the world, its pomps and
vexations. He repaired to the ancient monastery of
Cong, in Galway, and there, after twelve years of pious
devotion, on the 29th day of November, 1198, in the 82d
year of his age, this good and noble but irresolute monarch
surrendered his soul to God. He was not buried at
Cong, as some annalists have asserted, but in the chancel
of the Temple Mor, or Great Church, of Clonmacnois,
in the present King’s County, where he was educated.
Tradition has failed to preserve the location of the exact
place of sepulture within the ruined shrine. And so
ended the last Ard-Righ, or High King, that had swayed
the sceptre of an independent Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>King Henry’s claim that the Irish Church needed great
reformation is disproved by the enactments of his own
reign in that connection, viz.: 1. That the prohibition of
marriage within the canonical degrees of consanguinity
be enforced. 2. That children should be regularly catechized
before the church door in each parish. 3. That
children should be baptized in the public fonts of the
parish churches. 4. That regular tithes should be paid
to the clergy, rather than irregular donations from time
to time. 5. That church lands should be exempt from
the exaction of livery and other burdens. 6. That the
clergy should not be liable to any share of the eric, or
blood fine, levied off the kindred of a man guilty of
homicide. 7. A decree regulating the making of wills.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Surely, this was small ground on which to justify the
invasion of an independent country and the destruction
of its liberty!</p>

    <div>Prince John “Lackland” Created “Lord” of Ireland—Splendid Heroism of Sir Armoricus Tristram</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>HENRY II, whatever may have been his original intentions
toward Ireland and the Irish, soon after his
return to England assumed the tone of a conqueror and
dictator. He forgot, or appeared to forget, the treaty
he had concluded with King Roderick’s representatives
at Windsor, which distinctly recognized the tributary
sovereignty of the Irish monarch, and left the bulk of
the Irish people under the sway of their own native laws
and rulers. Now, however, he, in defiance of the commonest
law of honor, proclaimed his weakest and worst
son, the infamous John, “Lord” of Ireland—a title retained
by the English kings down to the reign of Henry
VIII, who, being a wily politician, contrived to get himself
“elected” as “King of Ireland.” This title remained
with the English monarchs until January 1, 1801, when
the ill-starred legislative union went into effect, and
George III of England became king of the so-called
“United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry II died in 1189, preceding the Irish king he
had so deeply wronged to the grave by about nine years.
His last hours were doubly imbittered by the discovery
that his youngest son, John, who was also his favorite,
and in whom he had concentrated all his paternal love
and confidence, was leagued with his enemies. An able,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>but thoroughly bad, man, Henry Plantagenet died a miserable
death—his heart filled with rage against his own
rebellious offspring, who, no doubt, only practiced the
perfidious policy inculcated by their miserable father.
The death scene occurred at Chinon, in Aquitaine, and
his last words, uttered in the French tongue, and despite
the vehement protests of the surrounding ecclesiastics,
were, “Accursed be the day on which I was born, and
accursed of God be the sons I leave after me!” His
curse did not fall on sticks and stones. All of his guilty
sons, except John, died violent and untimely deaths.
Lackland, the exception, died of an overdose of pears
and fresh cider, added to grief over the loss of his treasure,
which sunk in a quicksand while he was marching
with his guard along the English coast. Henry’s curse
remained with the Plantagenets to the end, and most
of the princes of that family met a horrible doom, from
Edward II, foully murdered in Berkeley Castle, to the
last male Plantagenet, of legitimate origin, the Earl of
Warwick, beheaded by order of Henry VII in 1499.
Strongbow, Henry’s chief tool in the acquirement of
Ireland, died of a dreadful blood malady, which, the
doctors said, resembled leprosy, some years before the
king. He is buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin,
and beside him are said to rest the relics of his only son,
killed by the ferocious father’s hand, because he fled
from the Irish in some border battle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before closing this chapter we may be allowed to remark
that Richard III, when he had his nephews murdered
in the Tower of London, in 1483, came legitimately
by his cruel nature. John Lackland was the progenitor of
all the Plantagenets who succeeded him on the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>throne, and, like his direct descendant, Richard Crookback,
was a usurper, because Prince Arthur, son of his
elder brother, Geoffrey Plantagenet, was lineal heir to
the throne. History and tradition agree in saying that
John caused Prince Arthur to be murdered, and some
historians say that he was the actual murderer. He was
the only coward of his race, and was, also, frivolous and
deliberately ill-mannered. When on a visit to Ireland, in
the supposed interest of his father, he caused a revolt
among the Irish chiefs who called upon him, by pulling
their long beards and otherwise insulting them. Those
cringing chiefs deserved the treatment they received,
but John Lackland, as he was dubbed, is not, therefore,
excusable for having acted toward them as a boor and
a ruffian. Later on, when he became King of England,
he again visited Ireland, and built many strong castles.
That of Limerick, called King John’s Castle, is still almost
perfectly preserved, and is a superb relic of Norman military
architecture. As the Irish were not provided with
armament, or appliances, for making a successful siege,
the fortresses built by King John were, so far as they
were concerned, virtually impregnable. Whenever the
Normans were vanquished in the field, they retired to
their castles, which were amply provisioned, and defied
the vengeance of their foes.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the last year of the reign of Henry II, there occurred
in Ireland one of those memorable combats which
deserve a lasting place in history, not so much because of
any important reform or social or political blessing of
any kind resulting from them, but as tending to show that
warrior men, in all ages, have often been chivalrous and
self-sacrificing. The Norman race—glorious as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>its record all over Europe and Palestine—never evinced
greater bravery than on the Woody field of Knocktuagh
(Nockthoo), “the Hill of Axes,” in Galway, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1189.
Sir John De Courcy, hard pressed in Ulster by the fiercely
resisting septs of the north, asked aid from his sworn
friend and comrade, Sir Armoricus Tristram—ancestor
of the family of St. Lawrence, Earls of Howth—then
serving in Connaught. Tristram had with him, according
to some accounts, thirty knights, one hundred men-at-arms,
mounted, and one hundred light-armed infantry;
according to other statements, he had under his command
thirty cavalry and two hundred foot. This force
Cathal O’Conor, afterward known as “the Red-Handed,”
Prince of the royal house of Connaught—a most valiant
and skilful general, who was younger brother, born out
of wedlock, of King Roderick, then virtually in the retirement
of the cloisters of Cong Abbey—led into an ambush,
and attacked with a superior force. Sir Armoricus
saw at a glance that escape was hopeless, and that only
one refuge was left for him and his following—to die
with honor. Some of his horsemen, tradition says, proposed
to cut their way out and leave the infantry to their
fate. Against this mean proposition Sir Armor’s brother
and other knights vehemently protested. “We have been
together in many dangers,” they said; “now let all of us
fight and die together.” Sir Armor, by way of answer,
alighted from his steed, drew his sword and, with it,
pierced the noble charger to the heart. All the other
horsemen, except two youths, who were detailed to watch
the fight from a distant hill, and report the result to De
Courcy in Ulster, immediately followed their glorious
leader’s example. Tradition asserts that the two young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>men who made their escape, by order, were Sir Armoricus’s
son and the squire of De Courcy, who brought the
latter’s message to Tristram. Having completed the
slaughter of their horses, the little band of Normans
formed themselves in a phalanx, and marched boldly to
attack the outnumbering Irish. The latter met the shock
with their usual courage, but the enemy, clad in armor,
cut their way deeply and fatally into the crowded ranks
of their cloth-clad foes. The Irish poet, Arthur Gerald
Geoghegan (Geh’ogan), thus graphically and truthfully
describes the dreadful encounter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then rose the roar of battle loud, the shout, the cheer, the cry!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The clank of ringing steel, the gasping groans of those who die;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet onward still the Norman band right fearless cut their way,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>As move the mowers o’er the sward upon a summer’s day.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“For round them there, like shorn grass, the foe in hundreds bleed;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet, fast as e’er they fall, each side, do hundreds more succeed;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With naked breasts undaunted meet the spears of steel-clad men,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And sturdily, with axe and skian, repay their blows again.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now crushed with odds, their phalanx broke, each Norman fights alone,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And few are left throughout the field, and they are feeble grown,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But high o’er all, Sir Tristram’s voice is like a trumpet heard,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And still, where’er he strikes, the foemen sink beneath his sword.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But once he raised his visor up—alas, it was to try</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If Hamo and his boy yet tarried on the mountain nigh,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When sharp an arrow from the foe pierced right through his brain,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And sank the gallant knight a corse upon the bloody plain.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Then failed the fight, for gathering round his lifeless body there,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The remnant of his gallant band fought fiercely in despair;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, one by one, they wounded fell—yet with their latest breath,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Their Norman war-cry shouted bold—then sank in silent death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When Cathal Mor finally became King of Connaught,
he caused a monastery, which he called “the Abbey of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Victory,” but which has been known to the Irish of Connaught
for ages as “Abbey Knockmoy,” to be erected on
or near the site of the battle. Tradition, not a very reliable
guide, fails to exactly define the scene of Cathal’s
victory over the Normans. Knocktuagh, an inconsiderable
eminence, is within a few miles of the city of Galway,
whereas Knockmoy, where stands the historic abbey, is
fully twelve miles east of that ancient borough, on the
highroad to Athlone. Cathal of the Red Hand fought
many battles and won many splendid victories, although
he occasionally sustained defeats at the hands of the Normans
and their traitorous native allies; his greatest victory
was won over his bitter rival, albeit his nephew,
Caher Carragh O’Conor, whom he encountered somewhere
in the county of Galway. There was an awful
slaughter on both sides, but Cathal prevailed, and, no
doubt, built the abbey on the spot where Caher and his
leading chieftains, Irish and Norman, fell. De Courcy
was the only foreigner allied with Cathal Mor in this
great battle. Abbey Knockmoy is one of the most interesting
of Irish ruins, and contains friezes and frescoing
most creditable to Irish art in the thirteenth century.
The victory gave Cathal Mor the undisputed sway of
Connaught. Adopting the policy of the invaders, for
the benefit of his country, he used Norman against Norman;
allied himself with Meyler FitzHenry, the last of
Strongbow’s lieutenants, to punish Connaught’s inveterate
foe, William de Burgo, ancestor of the Clanricardes
in Limerick, and to humble the pride of the ambitious
De Lacys in Leinster. In 1210, this gallant Irish monarch
compelled King John of England to treat with him
as an independent sovereign, and, while he lived, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Norman usurper dared to lord it over his kingdom of
Connaught. Like his royal father and brother, he was
a champion of the Irish Church, and was a liberal founder
and endower of religious houses. Had the Connacian
kings who followed been of his moral and military calibre,
the Normans could never have ruled in Connaught. Nor
did this great Irishman confine himself to his native
kingdom alone; he also assisted the other provinces in
resisting foreign encroachment. Even in his old age,
when the De Lacys tried to embarrass his reign by fortifying
Athleague, so as to threaten him in flank, the
dauntless hero, at the head of his hereditary power,
marched from his palace of Ballintober, made two crossings
of the river Suck, and, by a bold manœuvre, came on
the rear of the enemy, compelling them to retreat in all
haste across the Shannon into Leinster. He did not fail
to raze their forts at Athleague to the ground. This was
the last of his countless exploits. His time was drawing
nigh, and, according to the Four Masters, “signs appeared
in the heavens” which foretold his death. In
1223, Cathal’s load of age and care became too heavy,
and he resigned the crown of Connaught to his son, Hugh.
The old king, assuming the habit of the Franciscans, retired
to the Abbey of Knockmoy, and there expired,
mourned by his country and respected by its enemies,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1224. Tradition still points to his tomb amid the
majestic ruins of that venerable pile. His death was the
signal for the rise of Norman power in Connaught, and
for the final deposition by the alien De Burgos of the
royal race of O’Conor.</p>

    <div>Ireland Under the Earlier Edwards—The Younger Bruce Elected King by the Irish—Battle of Athenry—Death of Bruce at Faughart Hill</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>AFTER the death of King John, affairs in Ireland
proceeded tamely enough until the repeated encroachments
of the Anglo-Norman settlers and their progeny,
who occupied chiefly a comparatively small district called
“the Pale,” which consisted of most of the present counties
of Dublin, Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Kildare, and
Kilkenny, forced the native Irish to rise “in rude but
fierce array” against them. The Norman family of
De Lacy disputed supremacy in Leinster with the Fitzgeralds,
or Geraldines, but the latter, finally, outshone
their rivals both in court and camp. The De Courcys,
headed by the bold and chivalrous Sir John, “of that
ilk,” made some impression on the coast of Ulster. The
De Burgos, ancestors of all the Irish Burkes, became powerful
in Connaught, and the old Irish, headed by the
O’Conors, fought against them fiercely from time to time.
But the gallant, if covetous, Norman captains beheld the
Irish maidens, and saw that they were fair. Love-making,
despite frequent feuds, progressed between Norman
lord and Celtic virgin; and not uncommonly between
Irish prince and Norman lady. Many “mixed marriages”
resulted, and, naturally, racial animosities became
greatly softened, “for love will still be lord of all.”
Very soon the warrior Normans, who acknowledged but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>a doubtful allegiance to the English monarch, began to
assume Irish manners, wear the Irish costume, and speak
in the Gaelic tongue. All this did not suit the English
policy, and the Norman Irish were often described by
their kindred across the sea as “Degenerate English.”
It was written of the Fitzgeralds, in particular, that they
had grown “more Irish than the Irish.” This alarmed
England, for it began to look as if Norman and Celt in
Ireland would soon make common cause against her
power. But many Norman chiefs were land hungry,
and many of the Irish princes were fierce and filled with
a just wrath against their invaders. Gradually, therefore,
the Geraldines swept all before them in Kildare
and Desmond, for they were very warlike, and many
native Irish joined their fortunes to theirs, because of
“fosterage” and other interests. The Butlers possessed
themselves of large tracts of country in the present counties
of Kilkenny and Tipperary, and became Earls of
Ormond; and the De Burgos, as Earls of Clanricarde,
became, in great part, masters of Galway, Mayo, and
other parts of the province of Connaught. Factions
among the Celtic chiefs made their conquests easy. The
Normans, wily as they were brave, fostered these feuds,
and were particularly delighted when the formidable
O’Neills and O’Donnells of Ulster wasted their strength
in internecine strife. The politic foreigners occasionally
allied themselves to either one of the contending
septs, and generally succeeded in outwitting both contestants.
Yet, as time wore on, the Norman warriors,
forgetting their fathers’ speech, shouted their battle cries
in the Gaelic tongue, and, except for their armor, could
hardly be distinguished from the Celts.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Henry III paid but small attention to Irish affairs.
He ascended the English throne a minor, and his mature
years were spent mainly in repeated civil wars with his
barons, who finally compelled him to extend and confirm
the Magna Charta of his father. His son, Edward I,
nicknamed “Long Shanks,” the ablest king of the Plantagenet
race, was almost constantly occupied, during his
stirring reign, in wars of conquest against Wales and
Scotland, and he succeeded in annexing the first-named
country to the English crown. His son and successor,
Edward II, was the first English Prince of Wales. This
Edward inherited the Scotch war which his father had
left unfinished, after great effusion of blood. In 1314,
his great English army, said to have numbered 100,000
knights, archers, and men-at-arms, was disastrously
routed at Bannockburn (“Oaten-cake rivulet”), near
Sterling, by King Robert Bruce, of Scotland, who had
under his command not more than 30,000 men, horse and
foot. This great victory did not entirely end the Anglo-Scotch
wars, which were always bitter and bloody down
to the close of the sixteenth century, but it preserved the
independence of Scotland for nearly four hundred years.
That country ceased to be a separate nation in 1707.
Many Irish clans of Ulster aided Bruce at Bannockburn,
and some Connaught septs, under one of the O’Conors,
fought on the English side, and were nearly exterminated,
which “served them right.” As the Irish princes
could not settle on one of their own number for High
King, they, at the suggestion of the wise and generous
Donald O’Neill, King of Ulster, agreed to elect Edward
Bruce, brother of the Scotch monarch, king of all Ireland.
Their proffer of the Irish throne was accepted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the Bruces, and Edward was duly crowned in 1315.
This provoked a destructive three years’ war. Brave
King Robert came to Ireland to aid his brother, and, in
the field, they swept all before them, particularly in
Munster. But the Norman-Irish fought them bitterly,
notably the Geraldines, the Berminghams, and De Burgos.
Felim O’Conor, the young and gallant king of Connaught,
was forced into a repugnant alliance with De Burgo,
who was powerful in the west. His heart, however, was
with the Bruce, and he soon found an opportunity to
break away from his repugnant Norman ally. Summoning
all his fighting force, he marched upon the fortified
town of Athunree, or Athenry, “the Ford of the
Kings,” in Galway, and came up with the Anglo-Norman
army, arrayed outside the walls, on the morning of August
10, 1316. De Burgo and De Bermingham, two able
veteran soldiers, headed the Anglo-Normans. The conflict
was fierce and the slaughter appalling, particularly
on the Irish side, because the heroic clansmen did not
have, like their foes, the advantage of chain armor and
long bow archery. Night closed upon a terrible scene.
The Irish refused to fly and died in heaps around the lifeless
body of their chivalric young king, who, with twenty-eight
princes of his house, proudly fell on that bloody
field. Most of the Irish army perished—the loss being
usually estimated at 10,000 men. The Anglo-Normans
also suffered severely, but their armor proved the salvation
of most of them. Connaught did not recover from
this great disaster for many generations. Athenry proved
fatal to the cause of Bruce, although, gallantly seconded
by Donald O’Neill, he fought on for two years longer,
but was at last killed in battle on Faughart Hill, in Louth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1318. With him disappeared, for that century at
least, the hope of an independent Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the battle of Athenry, the power of the De
Burgo family, and of all the allies of their house, became
predominant in Connaught, but all these Anglo-Norman
chiefs became, also, much more Irish in manners
and sympathy than they had ever been before. The desperate
bravery displayed by O’Conor’s clansmen had
aroused the admiration of those born warriors, and they
felt that to ally themselves in marriage with so martial
a race was an honor, not a degradation, such as the
English sought to make it appear. Ulster maintained
its independence, and so also did much of Connaught and
portions of Munster and Leinster, and there were periodical
raids upon the Pale and carrying off of “Saxon”
flocks and herds, followed by feasts and general jubilation.
The Palesmen, whenever too weak to meet the
Celts in the field, would resort to their time-honored
strategy of shutting themselves up in their strongholds,
and making, whenever opportunity offered, fierce retaliatory
raids on the Irish territory. This kind of warfare
was unfortunate for Ireland, because it kept the English
feeling strong in the hearts of the Palesmen, who were
constantly recruited by fresh swarms of adventurers from
England. Outside of the Pale, however, the Old Irish
and the Normans continued to affiliate and intermarry,
as we have already said. Fosterage—a peculiarly Irish
custom, which meant that the children of the king, prince,
or chief should be nursed by the wives of the clansmen,
instead of their own mothers—grew apace, and nearly
every Norman lord had his heirs suckled by the women
of the Celtic race, thus creating a bond of “kinship”—if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>so it may be termed—in many instances stronger than
even the brotherhood of blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>Irish tradition abounds in examples of the devotion of
foster-brethren to each other; and in all written history
there is given but one instance of treachery in this connection,
and that instance does not involve a man of
Celtic, but of Latin, lineage. We refer to the betrayal
of Lord Thomas Fitzgerald by Parez in the reign of
Henry VIII, which will be dealt with in the proper place.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Prince Lionel Viceroy for Edward III—The Statute of Kilkenny</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>EDWARD III, that valiant, vigorous, and ambitious
“English” king—he was almost a pure-blooded
Frenchman and about the last Norman monarch who
occupied the throne of England that did not speak with
fluency the language of the people he governed—was so
occupied with his unjust wars against France that he
gave but small heed to Irish affairs and never visited the
island at all. But he sent over his third son, Prince
Lionel, ancestor of the royal house of York and Clarence,
as viceroy. Lionel had with him a well-equipped army of
native-born English, but he treated his Anglo-Irish allies
so contemptuously that many fell away from him and
joined the ranks of the Old Irish. His English army,
unaccustomed to the Irish climate and mode of warfare,
made but a poor figure in the field, and was everywhere
beaten by the dauntless Irish clansmen. At last he was
compelled to lower his imperious tone to the Anglo-Irish
and these foolishly helped him out of his scrape. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>said that a more than doubtful campaign in the present
county of Clare procured for him, from his flatterers,
the title of Duke of Clarence—a title, by the way, which
brought more or less misfortune to every English prince
who has borne it, except William IV, from his day to
our own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lionel was particularly jealous of the friendship which
seemed to exist between old Anglo-Irish and the old
Celtic-Irish, and his small mind conceived a method of
putting an end to it. He summoned a parliament to meet
at Kilkenny, and there it was enacted, among other
things, “that all intermarriages, fosterings, gossipred,
and buying or selling with the (Irish) enemy shall be
accounted treason; that English names, fashions, and
manners (most of these having disappeared) shall be
resumed under penalty of confiscation of the delinquent’s
lands; that March laws (Norman) and Brehon laws
(Irish) are illegal, and that there shall be no laws but
English laws; that the Irish shall not pasture their cattle
on English lands; that the English shall not entertain
Irish rhymers, minstrels, or newsmen, and, moreover,
that no ‘mere Irishman’ shall be admitted to any ecclesiastical
benefice or religious house (England was then all
Catholic) situated within the English district.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Other provisions of the Statute of Kilkenny, as this
precious “law” is called in Irish history, forbade the
wearing of long hair, mustaches, and cloaks, after the
manner of the Irish, and the use of the Gaelic speech
was also forbidden, under heavy penalties. With their
usual subserviency to English demands, the Anglo-Irish
barons of the Pale—the portion of Ireland held by the
English settlers, as already explained—passed this barbarous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>enactment without opposition, although they
themselves were the chief “offenders” against it, in the
eyes of the tyrannical viceroy.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the honor of the Anglo-Normans and Celtic-Irish
be it remembered, the base statute became almost immediately
inoperative, and the Norman lords and Irish
ladies, and the Irish princes and the Norman ladies, intermarried
more numerously than before—an example
generally followed by their dependants. The gallant
house of Fitzgerald, or Geraldine, as usual, set the example
of disregard.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“These Geraldines! These Geraldines! Not long her air they breathed—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not long they fed on venison in Irish water seethed—</div>
      <div class='line'>Not often had their children been by Irish mothers nursed,</div>
      <div class='line'>When from their full and genial hearts an Irish feeling burst!</div>
      <div class='line'>The English monarch strove in vain, by law and force and bribe,</div>
      <div class='line'>To win from Irish thoughts and ways this ‘more than Irish’ tribe;</div>
      <div class='line'>For still they clung to fosterage—to Brehon, cloak, and bard—</div>
      <div class='line'>No king dare say to Geraldine: ‘Your Irish wife discard!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The immediate effect of the Statute of Kilkenny was
to temporarily unite most of the Irish clans against the
common enemy. They fell fiercely upon the Pale and
again shut up the Normans in their fortresses. Prince
Lionel returned to England grieved and humiliated. His
viceroyalty had been a signal failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Throughout the viceroyalty of Clarence and his successor,
William de Windsor, the desultory war between
the Old Irish and the Anglo-Normans made many districts,
in all the provinces, red with slaughter. The power
of the De Burgos declined in Connaught after the death
of the warlike Red Earl, who was the scourge of the
O’Conors, and the latter family brought his descendants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>who had assumed the name of MacWilliam, under their
sway. The fierce tribes of Wicklow, Wexford, and Carlow
harried the Pale, and were frequently joined by the
O’Mores of Leix, and the Fitzpatricks of Ossory. In
Ulster, Niel O’Neill, Prince of Tyrone, attacked and defeated
the English armies and garrisons with so much
success that he cleared Ulster of all foreigners, and won
the title of Niel the Great. The Earl of Desmond met
with a severe defeat at the hands of O’Brien, Prince of
Thomond, who assailed him near the abbey of Adare
in Limerick, and routed his army with terrible carnage.
Desmond himself was mortally wounded and died upon
the field. The Earl of Kildare, Desmond’s kinsman, attempted
to avenge his rout, but met with scant success,
because the Irish had, by this time, grown used to the
Norman method of warfare, and, in many cases, improved
upon the tactics of their oppressors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Edward III, just before his death in 1376, attempted
to get the settlements of the Pale to send representatives
to London to consult about the affairs of Ireland, but they
demurred, saying that it was not their custom to deliberate
outside of their own country. However, they sent
delegates to explain matters to the king, who did not
further insist on convening a Pale Parliament in the
English capital. It is strange that so able a monarch
as Edward was, even in his declining years, never thought
of visiting Ireland. Of course, most of his reign was
taken up with the wars in France, in which he proved
so signally victorious, and he had but little time for other
occupations. In truth, Edward III, although nominally
English, was, in reality, a Frenchman in thought and
speech, and his dearest dream was to rule over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>country of his Plantagenet ancestors, with England as a
kind of tributary province. Of course, the English people
would never have acquiesced in this arrangement, for,
however willing to impose their yoke on other peoples,
they are unalterably opposed to having any foreign yoke
imposed upon themselves.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Richard II’s Invasions—Heroic Art MacMurrough</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE first half of the fourteenth century passed
away quietly enough in Ireland, except for occasional
conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the
Celtic tribes, or an odd encounter of the latter with one
another. Edward III had so many quarrels with Scotland
and France that he could do nothing in Ireland,
even were he so inclined, and the sad experience of the
Duke of Clarence in that country warned succeeding
viceroys to let well enough alone. The Irish nation,
Celtic, Norman, and Saxon, was gradually fusing and
would soon have developed a composite strength nearly
equal to that of England herself. In the wars with
France, many Anglo-Irish septs fought under the orders
of Edward, and, probably, some of the Celtic septs also
joined his standard, rather as allies, through the bad
policy of their chiefs, than as mercenaries.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the time that Edward completed, or nearly so, the
conquest of France, the English power in Ireland had
so shrunken as to be almost nominal. Dublin, Drogheda,
Kilkenny, and Waterford were the chief garrisons of the
English. The Lacys, Burkes, Fitzgeralds, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Norman-Irish houses and clans were scarcely to be distinguished
from the Milesian families and septs. Such
fighting as they indulged in between themselves was
comparatively trivial. The island, blessed with partial
peace, began to grow more populous and prosperous.
Edward, the Black Prince, having crowned himself with
glory in France, died before he could inherit the crown
of England. Edward III, not so old as worn out by
ceaseless warfare, died in 1377, and after him came to
the English throne Richard, son of the Black Prince, a
handsome boy of sixteen, who, at first, gave promise of
great deeds, but who subsequently proved himself a weakling
and voluptuary. In Ireland, Ulster, Connaught, and
Munster remained tranquil for the most part, but, in
Leinster, the royal house of MacMurrough—lineal descendants
of the traitor of Strongbow’s time—showed
a determination to drive the remnant of the English garrison
into the sea. They were as loyal to Ireland as their
accursed ancestor had been faithless. King Art I, after
a long series of successes and failures, died, and was succeeded
on the Leinster throne by King Art II—one of the
bravest, wisest, and truest characters in Irish history.
He continued the war his father had begun. Richard II,
like all of his race, was vain and greedy of military glory.
As the war with France had closed for a period, he
thought Ireland a good field in which to distinguish himself
as a general. He had heard of “MacMore,” as he
called MacMurrough, and longed to measure swords with
him. Accordingly, in the summer of 1394, he landed
at Waterford with a large army. The historian McGee
estimates it at 35,000 horse and foot, but we are inclined
to think it was much less. That it was formidable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>for those times, all historians who have dealt with the
subject are agreed upon. He was accompanied, also, by
a large retinue of nobility, among them Roger Mortimer,
the young Earl of March, who, because of the childlessness
of Richard, was heir to the British throne, through
descent from the Duke of Clarence, in the female line.
Richard did not wait long in Waterford, but proceeded on
his march to Dublin, unfurling the banner of Edward the
Confessor, for whom the Irish were supposed to have a
deep veneration. MacMurrough, however, showed scant
courtesy to the Confessor’s ensign, not because it was the
banner of a saint, but because, for the time, it represented
the rapacity of England. Richard was met boldly
at every point. His bowmen got tangled up in the woods.
His horsemen floundered in the bogs. MacMurrough’s
army hovered in his front, on his flanks, and in rear.
Not a single success did the English monarch gain. He
summoned MacMurrough to a conference when he
reached Dublin—having lost a third of his army while
en route—and the Leinster king, having accepted the invitation,
was ruthlessly thrown into prison. After a
time, a treaty of some kind was patched up between King
Richard and himself, and the Irish prince was allowed to
go free. Richard then returned to England, leaving
Roger Mortimer in command. Soon afterward, MacMurrough,
objecting to the English encroachments in his
territory, again rose in arms. He encountered Mortimer
and the English army on the banks of the King’s River at
Kenlis or Kells in Westmeath, and utterly routed them.
England’s heir-apparent was among the slain. This circumstance
had much to do with bringing about the bloody
Wars of the Roses in the succeeding century.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>About this time Art MacMurrough and his chief bard,
who, as was then the Irish custom, accompanied his patron
everywhere, were invited to a banquet by one of the
Norman lords, who treacherously pretended friendship.
The invitation was accepted. While seated at a window
of the banquet-hall, the bard perceived a mustering of
troops around the castle, and at once seized his harp and
struck the chords to an ancient Irish air. The Gaelic
words which accompanied the measure fell upon the ears
of Art MacMurrough and warned him of his danger.
His sword and buckler hung near by. On some trivial
pretext, he arose and seized them, the bard having, meanwhile,
armed himself. The two made a sudden onslaught
and, surprising their foes, cut their way to the courtyard,
where, fortunately, their horses still stood. They
sprang upon them, and, before the astonished men-at-arms
could rally, made good their escape. Art MacMurrough
never again trusted the English, and remained
their consistent foe to his latest hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>But King Richard, maddened by the death of Mortimer,
which he felt was dangerous to himself, raised another
great army, and, in 1398, again invaded Ireland.
He was accompanied by a younger son of his uncle, John
of Gaunt, “time-honored Lancaster,” and also by Prince
Henry, eldest son of Henry of Hereford and afterward
Henry V, the hero of Agincourt. The boy was only in
his twelfth year, but well grown and brave as a lion. In
the first encounter with the formidable MacMurrough,
in the glens of Carlow, he so distinguished himself that
Richard II knighted him on the field. This march from
Waterford to Dublin proved, in the end, even more disastrous
than the former one. MacMurrough kept up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>his harassing tactics, as usual. The rain poured down
in torrents. The Irish drove all the cattle away from
the English line of march, and destroyed the growing
crops. Nearly all the baggage-animals of the invading
force died for want of forage, and the army was in a
state of famine and revolt, when it finally reached the
seacoast near the present town of Arklow, where some
English ships, laden with provisions, saved it from actual
starvation. The remnant made its way to Dublin, where
other disastrous news awaited King Richard. Henry
of Hereford, eldest son of John of Gaunt, whom he had
unjustly exiled, and whose lands he had seized, now, on
the death of his father, having become Duke of Lancaster,
came back from the continent, having heard of Richard’s
misfortunes in Ireland, and laid claim to the crown.
Richard, after ordering young Prince Henry and his
uncle to be imprisoned in the castle of Trim—still one of
the finest Norman keeps in Ireland—set sail for England.
Henry, who had by this time raised a large army,
made him prisoner and sent him to Pontefract Castle, in
Yorkshire, where, soon afterward, he was starved to
death, or otherwise foully made away with. Prince
Henry and his uncle were immediately released when
the Duke of Lancaster ascended a usurped throne as
Henry IV of England. And thus was laid the bloody
foundation of the dreadful after wars between the rival
royal houses of York and Lancaster, which ended in the
extermination of the legitimate Plantagenets. An illegitimate
branch, directly descended from John of Gaunt,
still survives in the ducal house of Beaufort.</p>

<p class='c009'>Art MacMurrough remained a conqueror to the end,
and kept up the war with the Normans. In 1404, he defeated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>at Athcroe (Ford of Slaughter), near Dublin,
Lord Thomas of Lancaster, brother of the king, putting
most of the English to the sword, and desperately wounding
the prince himself. Only a few years ago, Irish laborers,
excavating for a railroad at Athcroe, came upon
nearly a thousand bent swords, some of them badly decomposed
by rust, buried in the river bed. They were
the swords taken from the dead English, in 1404, and
bent across the knees of the victorious Irish, according
to their custom in those days.</p>

<p class='c009'>MacMurrough’s career of glory continued until 1417,
when, having captured all the important towns of Leinster,
except Dublin and Drogheda, he died at his capital
of New Ross—then the second city in Ireland—as some
say by poison, in the sixtieth year of his age and forty-fourth
of his reign. Taken for all in all, he was not alone
the bravest, but the ablest, of Irish princes and warriors
since the days of King Brian, and it was a sad day for
Ireland when the word went through Leinster and rang
around the island that King Art was dead. Many a dark
generation passed away before such another chief, or
any one worthy to be mentioned as a rival of his fame,
arose in that unfortunate land.</p>

    <div>Ireland During the Wars of the Roses</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>AFTER the premature death of Henry IV, an able
but unscrupulous sovereign, in 1413, the attention
of England was again directed to the conquest of France
by the chivalrous and skilful Henry V. His capture of
Harfleur and marvelous victory of Agincourt, against
overwhelming odds, in 1415, stamp him as one of the
world’s great military leaders. During the nine years of
his reign, he succeeded in subduing France, and, finally,
married Catherine, heiress of Charles VI, an almost imbecile
king, and had himself declared regent and next in
succession to the throne after his father-in-law. France
was stupefied, but God, infinitely stronger than French
arms, decreed Henry’s early death. He died in the conquered
country in 1422, leaving an only son, Henry VI,
an infant of nine months, to succeed him, under the regency
of his uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who,
for a wonder, considering the history of the Plantagenets,
remained faithful to his trust. John, Duke of Bedford,
a younger brother of Henry, and a very brilliant
soldier, became regent of France. This was the period
of the inspired peasant-girl, Joan of Arc, whose story of
victory and death belongs to the history of France, although,
after having performed prodigies, she died at the
stake to which the English, into whose hands she had
fallen, condemned her. The Dauphin, as Charles VII,
succeeded to his legitimate throne, and, about 1453, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>English were expelled from France, except the old town
of Calais, which remained in their possession until 1558.
In Ireland, meanwhile, the chief feuds were those between
the Geraldines and the Butlers and the De Burgos
and the Connaught chiefs. There were also minor feuds
in different parts of the island, but, as a rule, the Irish
people had things pretty much their own way, and might
have thrown off the English yoke utterly, if they had had
an Edward Bruce or Art MacMurrough to arouse and
lead them to victory. Unfortunately they had not, and,
as the English fetter was very light on Ireland during
the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455, they imagined,
perhaps, that the old enemy, having plenty of fighting
to do on their own account, might leave them alone
for evermore—a vain hope if it were seriously entertained.</p>

<p class='c009'>After an interval of six years, the Wars of the Roses—so-called
because the red rose was the badge of the
House of Lancaster and the white that of the House of
York—broke out more violently than before, because Henry
VI, who had been declared imbecile and unfit to reign,
suddenly recovered his intellect, and Richard Plantagenet,
Duke of York, who claimed a prior right to the
throne, and had been appointed Regent, with the right
of succession, refused to give up his authority. Henry
had a son by his brave wife, Margaret of Anjou. He
might be called a weakling, but she summoned the people
to defend the rights of her son. York was defeated,
captured, and beheaded at Wakefield, in 1461, but his
son Edward, Earl of March, routed the queen’s army immediately
afterward and ascended the throne as Edward
IV. Struggle succeeded struggle, but the House of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>York achieved a crowning triumph at Tewkesbury and
again at Barnet Heath, where Warwick, the King Maker,
fell. The direct male line of the House of Lancaster
perished at Tewkesbury, where, it is alleged, the gallant
Prince Edward, son of Henry VI, was murdered, after
having been made prisoner, by Edward IV and George,
Duke of Clarence—the same afterward drowned in a
butt of wine by order of his cruel brother. King Edward
IV, after a reign of twenty-two years, marked
by slaughter of his foes and some of his friends, notorious
immorality, and swinish debauchery, died of a
fever brought on by his excesses, in 1483, and his vile
younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, succeeded the
boy-king, Edward V, by process of murder, in the same
year. The last battle of the Wars of the Roses was
fought at Bosworth, near Leicester, August 22, 1485.
Richard, last king of the Plantagenet family, fell and was
succeeded by his rival, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond,
descended, in the female line, from John of Gaunt, who
ascended the throne as Henry VII.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, you will see, Ireland was left pretty much to herself,
during those thirty years of English civil war, in
which twelve murderous pitched battles were fought.
Most of the old nobility were killed in battle or executed,
or otherwise destroyed, and more than one hundred
thousand Englishmen of the middle and lower classes
were immolated on the smoking altars of family pride
and savage ambition. Every prince of the race of Plantagenet
was exterminated when, in 1599, Henry VII
ordered the beheading of the young Earl of Warwick,
son of the Duke of Clarence. Many of the Anglo-Irish
lords and their followings took part in the English wars,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>mainly on the side of the House of York, and the Geraldines,
in particular, got sadly mixed up in them, for
which they suffered amply in after days. No reigning
king of England had set foot in Ireland since Richard
II sailed to his death from Dublin, and Henry VII
proved to be no exception to the rule. He, however, interfered
in the quarrel between the Fitzgeralds and the
Butlers—as bitter and prolonged as that between the
Camerons and Campbells in Scotland—and made the Earl
of Kildare viceroy. The Desmonds, the powerful southern
branch of the Geraldines, were also eternally at
variance with the Butlers. It is related that, on one occasion,
the Earl of Desmond was wounded and made prisoner.
While being borne on a litter to Butler’s stronghold,
one of the bearers insolently and brutally demanded,
“Where is the great Earl of Desmond now?” To which
the heroic captive immediately replied—“Where he ought
to be” (alluding to the litter in which he was carried by
his foes): “still on the necks of the Butlers!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The most memorable event of Henry VII’s reign, as
far as Ireland was concerned, was the coming over from
England of Sir Edward Poynings, as Lord Deputy during
the temporary retirement of Kildare. The English
colonists of the Pale, almost from their first settlement
of that district, possessed an independent parliament,
modeled on that of England. It was, in general, oppressive
toward the Celtic-Irish, but made good laws
enough for the Palesmen. Poynings, soon after his arrival,
called this parliament to assemble at Drogheda and
there (1495) the Statute of Kilkenny was reaffirmed,
except as regarded the prohibition of Gaelic, which had
come into general use, even in the Pale itself. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>main enactment—the first uttered in the English tongue
in Ireland—was that known as 10 Henry VII, otherwise
Poynings’ Law, which provided that no legislation should
be, thereafter, proceeded with in Ireland unless the bills
were first submitted for approval or rejection to the
monarch and privy council of England. In case of approval
they were to be attested by the great seal of the
English realm. It was, to be sure, a most unjust and
insolent measure, and it seems almost incredible that even
the Pales people—mere hybrids, neither English nor Irish—should
have tamely submitted to its infamous provisions.
It remained in force 287 years, or until 1782,
when it was repealed under circumstances that will appear
hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The close of this reign witnessed a bloody struggle
between the Kildares and Clanricardes, in which many
Celtic tribes also bore a part, and in which thousands of
men lost their lives to no good purpose. In the two
principal battles, those of Knockdoe and Monabraher
(1507-10), artillery and musketry were first made use of
on Irish soil.</p>

<p class='c009'>As most of the Irish Palesmen, including the House
of Kildare, were partisans of the House of York during
the Wars of the Roses, the two pretenders—prepared
by Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward
IV, to impersonate, respectively, Edward, Earl of Warwick,
only son and heir of the late Duke of Clarence,
and Richard, Duke of York, the second son of Edward
IV, who was murdered in the Tower, by order, it is
said, of his base uncle, Richard III, together with his
brother, the boy-king, Edward V—found adherents when
they landed on Irish soil. Indeed, Lambert Simnel, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>first of these pretenders, a handsome young Englishman,
who resembled the princes of the House of York,
was crowned king, as “Edward VI,” in Christ Church
Cathedral, Dublin. Many Pales Irish followed him to
England, where Henry VII defeated and made him prisoner.
The real Warwick was taken from the Tower and
paraded through the streets-a sad spectacle of physical
comeliness marred, and intellect clouded, by long and
harsh confinement. Having been sufficiently exhibited
to satisfy the public of Simnel’s imposture, the poor boy
was returned to his cell. Simnel, himself, was made a
“turnspit” in the royal kitchen, afterward raised to the
post of falconer, and ended his days in that humble position.
The second pretender, Perkin Warbeck, a Belgian
by birth, had less support from Ireland than his predecessor,
but involved some of the nobles of the Pale with
King Henry. But his adherents, remembering the imposition
of the bogus Edward VI, soon fell away, and
Perkin went to Scotland, where James IV received him,
as if he were a genuine prince, and gave him his cousin,
the lovely Lady Catherine Gordon, in marriage. Peace
being concluded between James and Henry, Warbeck
and his beautiful bride went to Cornwall. There the
pretender, who was really a man of noble presence and
great ability, rallied 3,000 men to his standard. Successful
at first, he proved himself a false Plantagenet
by basely deserting his confiding followers on the eve
of decisive battle. He shut himself up in the sanctuary
of Beaulieu, in the New Forest, but soon surrendered
himself, and was shown by the king to the populace of
London. He was well treated for a time, but his position
was mortifying. He ran off to another sanctuary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>was again forced to give himself up, was placed in the
public stocks, confessed he was an impostor, and was
finally sent to the Tower, to keep company with the
unhappy Warwick. This circumstance enabled the crafty
Henry to get up a so-called plot, of which it was easy
to convict two helpless prisoners. Warwick—last male
of the Plantagenets—lost his head on Tower Hill, and
Warbeck died by the rope at Tyburn. His charming
widow became lady-in-waiting to the Queen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many abbeys and monasteries were built in Ireland
during this comparatively tranquil period, and the passion
for learning revived to a great extent among the native
Irish nobility. Pilgrimages, as of old, were made to
distant lands for the purpose of worshiping at famous
shrines. Irish teachers and scholars began again to be
numerous in Spain, Germany, and Italy. Henry VII,
engaged in saving the wreck of England’s almost extinguished
nobility, and in hoarding money, for which
he had a passion, took little account of Ireland and the
Irish. But, already, low on the horizon, a blood-red
cloud was forming, and it gradually thickened and extended
until, at last, it broke in a crimson torrent on
the fated Irish nation.</p>

    <div>The “Reformation”—New Cause of Discord in Ireland</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE bitterness of race hatred had almost died out
when the Reformation, as the opponents of the
Church of Rome called the great schism of the sixteenth
century, began to shake Europe like an earthquake.
Luther, and other dissenters from Catholic faith, carried
most of the north of Europe with them. The Latin countries,
South Germany, all of Ireland, and most of England,
clung to the old faith, and Henry VIII, who succeeded
his father at an early age, and was quite learned
in theology, wrote a pamphlet defending the Catholic
dogmas against Luther and the others. This work procured
for him from the Pope the title of the “Defender
of the Faith,” which still, rather inappropriately, belongs
to the sovereign of England. But Henry was a good
Catholic only so long as religion did not interfere with
his passions and ambitions. He had been married in
early life to Catherine of Aragon, who had been the
nominal wife of his elder brother, another Prince of
Wales, who died uncrowned. After many years, Henry,
who was a slave to his passions, tired of Catherine, and
pretended to believe that it was sinful to live with his
brother’s widow, even though the latter relationship was
but nominal. In truth, he had fallen in love with Anne
Boleyn, one of Queen Catherine’s maids-of-honor. The
Pope was appealed to for a divorce and refused to grant
it, after having carefully examined into the case. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Henry severed England’s spiritual connection with Rome,
and declared himself head of the English “Reformed”
Church. In this he was sustained by Wolsey, Cromwell,
and other high churchmen, all of whom were either ambitious
or afraid of their heads, for Henry never hesitated,
like his grand-uncle, Richard III, at the use of
the axe, when any subject, clerical or lay, opposed his
will. But the tyrant, while refusing allegiance to the
Pope, still maintained the truth of Catholic dogma, and
he murdered with studied impartiality those who gave
their adhesion to the Holy See and those who denied its
doctrines; no Englishman of note felt his head safe in
those red days. As for the common people, nobody of
“rank” ever gave them a thought. Henry now seized
upon the Church property, and, therewith, bribed the
great lords to take his side of the controversy. The
boors followed the lords, and so most of England followed
Henry’s schism and prepared to go farther.</p>

<p class='c009'>Henry married Anne Boleyn when he had “divorced”
Queen Catherine. After the Princess Elizabeth was
born, he tired of his new wife, had her tried for faithlessness
and high treason and beheaded. Scarcely was she
dead when the inhuman brute married Lady Jane Seymour,
of the great Somerset family. She gave birth to
Prince Edward and died. Then he married Anne of
Cleves, but, not liking her person, “divorced” her and
sent her back to Germany. For “imposing” her on him,
he disgraced, and finally beheaded, the Lord Chancellor,
Thomas Cromwell, who had been his great friend. The
monster next espoused Lady Catherine Howard, of the
House of Surrey, but he had her beheaded, on charges
almost similar to those urged against Anne Boleyn, within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the year. At last he married a widow of two experiences,
Lady Catharine Parr, who, being a woman of tact
and cleverness, managed to save her head, although frequently
in danger, until the ferocious king, who must
have been somewhat insane, finally fell a victim to his
own unbridled vices. “The plain truth,” says Charles
Dickens, in his “Child’s History,” “is that Henry VIII
was a most intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human
nature, and a blot of blood and grease upon the history
of England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the crowned “fiend in human shape” who
sought to effect his “Reformation in Ireland,” where both
the Old Irish and the Old English had united against his
tyranny. The weight of his wrath fell first upon the Leinster
Geraldines, whom he dreaded. He contrived to pick
a quarrel with Gerald, ninth Earl of Kildare, who had
been for many years his favorite viceroy in Ireland, and
summoned him to London in hot haste, on flimsy, notoriously
“trumped-up” charges of treason. He flung him
into a dungeon in the Tower of London. Lord Thomas
Fitzgerald, son of the Earl, called “Silken Thomas,”
because of the beauty of his person and the splendor of
his apparel, was appointed deputy by his father, who
thought his absence in England might be brief. Lord
Thomas was young, brave, and rash, and, in short, the
very man to fall an easy victim to the wiles of his
House’s enemies. Tradition says that the false news of
Earl Gerald’s execution, by order of King Henry, was
spread in Dublin by one of the Butlers. The privy council,
over which he usually presided, was already in session
at St. Mary’s Abbey, when “Silken Thomas” heard the
story. He, at once, with a large escort, proceeded to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>abbey, renounced his allegiance to the English monarch,
and, seizing the sword of state from the sword-bearer,
threw it, with violent gesture, on the council table, “the
English Thanes among.” Protests availed nothing. He
rushed to arms, and for nearly two years held at bay
Henry’s power. Had he but laid his plans with care and
judgment, he would, no doubt, have ended the rule of
England over Ireland, which, although not his primary,
became his ultimate, object. In the end, his stronghold
of Maynooth Castle was betrayed into the hands of the
English general, Sir William Skeffington, by Lord
Thomas’s foster-brother, Parez, for a sum in gold.
General Skeffington paid the money on the surrender of
the castle, and immediately hanged the traitor. For this
act of chivalric justice, the name of that stern Englishman
is still held in respect by all readers of Irish history.
The loss of Maynooth depleted the strength of “Silken
Thomas.” He struggled on for some time longer, but, at
last, accepted the terms of Lord Deputy Gray, who offered
him his life and guaranteed the safety of his five uncles—two,
at least, of whom had had no hand in the outbreak.
They were invited to a banquet by the Lord Deputy, and
there, while drinking with their false hosts, were treacherously
seized, placed in irons, and sent to England in
a ship called the <i>Cow</i>. One of the uncles, hearing the
name of the vessel, said: “We are lost! I have dreamed
that six of us, Geraldines, would be carried to England
in the belly of a cow and there lose our heads!” The
augury was fulfilled. Henry VIII, with his usual disregard
of terms, had them beheaded immediately after their
arrival in London, at Tyburn. The old Earl of Kildare
had not been executed after all, but died of a broken heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>in the Tower on learning of the revolt and misfortunes of
his son. Only one heir-male of the noble House of Kildare
now survived, and for him, although only twelve
years old, Henry sought, through his agents, with the
relentless ferocity of a Herod. The boy was related to
the great Celtic houses, for the Geraldines of that period
preferred Irish wives, and his mother was a princess
of the House of O’Neill of Ulster. By her, and by other
noble Irish ladies, he was concealed and protected until
he was enabled to escape to France. Thence he proceeded
to Rome, where he was educated as befitted his
rank and lineage. This young Gerald was restored to
his titles and estates by Queen Mary I, but he accepted
Protestantism when Elizabeth came to the throne, because,
otherwise, he could not have saved land and title—a most
unworthy motive, but one very common in that violent
and sanguinary era. In his descendants the elder Geraldine
branch still lives in Ireland—the present head of
the family being Maurice Fitzgerald, “the boy-Duke” of
Leinster.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bluff King Hal,” as the English called their royal
Bluebeard, never did anything by halves, if he could help
it. He did not think the title of “Lord of Ireland” sufficient
for his dignity, and set about intriguing to be elected
king. Accordingly, he caused to be summoned a parliament,
or rather what we of to-day would call a convention,
composed of Anglo-Irish barons and Celto-Irish
chiefs, to meet in Dublin, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1541. This parliament or
convention, at which the great Ulster princes, O’Neill and
O’Donnell, did not attend, voted Henry the crown of Ireland—something
the Irish chiefs, at least, had no power
to do, as they held their titles by election of their clans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and not by right of heredity. The outcome was, however,
that Henry became King of Ireland—the first English
monarch to achieve that distinction. In order to
emphasize his power, he at once decreed that the old titles
of the Irish princes should give way to English ones.
Thus “The O’Brien” became “Earl of Thomond”; “The
MacWilliam,” “Earl of Clanricarde”; “The MacMurrough”
became “Baron of Ballynun,” and changed his family
name to Kavanagh. Shameful to relate, O’Neill and
O’Donnell, both old men, broken in health, “came in” and
joined the titled serfs. The former became “Earl of
Tyrone” and the latter “Earl of Tyrconnel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the news reached the Irish clansmen, there was
a general revolt and new chiefs of the same families, with
the old Irish designations unchanged, were elected. The
English interest supported “the King’s O’Donnell” and
the others of his type, while the bulk of the Irish people
stood for the newly chosen leaders. Thus was still another
firebrand cast by English policy among the Irish
people, and there was civil war, thenceforth, for generations
in the clans themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor was Henry satisfied with mere civil supremacy in
Ireland. He also set himself up as head of the Irish
Church. Many Anglo-Irish Catholic bishops basely acquiesced
in his policy, but the Celtic bishops, almost to
a man, spurned his propositions. The masses of the Irish
nation, whether of Celtic, Norman, or Saxon origin, remained
steadfastly Catholic, although, in the past, they
had had little cause to be pleased with the political action
of the Vatican, which had generally sided with the Catholic
monarchs of England against Ireland’s aspirations
after independence. Now, however, the favored country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>had become Rome’s most deadly enemy in Europe, while
Ireland, inhabited by a highly spirited and stubborn people,
who venerated the creed taught their fathers by St.
Patrick, became the foremost European champion of the
old faith.</p>

<p class='c009'>We can not dwell at greater length on this lurid dawn
of the Reformation in Ireland, because, fierce as was the
persecution under Henry, it was trivial compared with
what followed his reign, and made the distracted island a
veritable den of outrage and slaughter.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>The Reformation Period Continued—Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth, and “John the Proud”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WHEN Edward VI, another boy-king, came to the
throne, in 1547, Ireland was pretty well distracted,
owing to the seeds of discord sown by his ferocious father.
The young monarch was under the absolute control of his
maternal kinsmen, the Seymours, and all that was done to
forward the Reformation in Ireland during his brief reign
may be justly attributed to them. On his death, in 1553,
Mary, daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon,
and wife of Philip II of Spain, succeeded. She was a
bigoted Catholic and soon made things decidedly warm
for the Protestants in England. Many of these fled for
safety to Ireland, where the Catholic people—incapable
of cruelty until demoralized by the ruthless tyranny of
religious persecution—received and sheltered them—a
noble page of Anglo-Irish history.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Reformation, of course, came to a standstill in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Ireland, during this queen’s reign, but the plunder and
persecution of the Irish people did not, therefore, abate.
There were raids and massacres and confiscations, as
usual. Of course there were bloody reprisals on the part
of the Irish, also—as was but natural. Some of the old
Irish districts—particularly Leix and Offaly—were, under
the sway of Mary, called the King’s and Queen’s
Counties—the chief town of the one being named Philipstown,
after the queen’s Spanish husband, and the capital
of the other Maryborough, after herself. The Irish Reformers
“laid low,” as was prudent in them, during
Mary’s period of power, because she had the unpleasant
Tudor habit of putting to death, by divers violent modes
of punishment, those who presumed to differ from her
rather strong opinions. The English, who sincerely rejoiced
when, after reigning about five years, she passed
to her account, nicknamed her “Bloody Mary,” although
she was not a whit “bloodier” than her awful father, and
had a very formidable rival for sanguinary “honors” in
her younger half-sister, Elizabeth. Mary Tudor was the
last <i>avowed</i> Catholic monarch who reigned in England,
except the ill-fated James II. In this reign, the English
law of primogeniture was first generally introduced into
the Celtic districts annexed to the Pale, which had been
divided into “shire-ground,” and this was the cause of
much internal disorder among the Irish tribes that clung
to the old elective system of chieftaincy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Elizabeth, called by her admiring English subjects
“Good Queen Bess,” on very insufficient grounds, ascended
the throne in 1558. She had, apparently, “conformed”
to Catholicity during the lively reign of her half-sister,
fearing, no doubt, for her head in case of refusal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Henry VIII’s daughter, by Anne Boleyn, she inherited
great energy of character, a masculine intellect, superabundant
vanity, a passion for empire, and a genius for
intrigue. Her morals were none of the best, according
to many historians. She was, for that age, highly educated,
could speak divers tongues, and possessed many
of the polite accomplishments. Indeed, she was somewhat
of a female pedant. In person, while yet young, she was
not ill-favored, being well-formed and of good stature.
Her complexion was fair, her hair auburn, and her eyes
small, but dark and sparkling. Her temper was irritable;
she swore when angry, and, at times, her disposition was
as ferocious as that of “Old Hal” himself. Like his, her
loves were passing passions, and her friendship dangerous
to those on whom she lavished it most freely. Flattery
was the surest way by which to reach her consideration,
but, in affairs of state, not even that could cloud her powerful
understanding or balk her resolute will. She resolved
to finish what her father and brother had begun,
and finish it to the purpose—namely, the Reformation—in
both England and Ireland. In the former country,
her will soon became law, and Rome ceased to be considered,
for generations, as a factor in English affairs.
In Ireland, it was different. The people there refused,
as a great majority, to conform to the new order of
things. They obeyed the Pope, as their spiritual chief,
and went to mass and received the sacraments as usual.
In Ulster, particularly, the people, headed by John O’Neill,
Prince of Tyrone, surnamed “The Proud,” resisted all
English encroachments, civil and religious. A bloody
war resulted. The English generals and some of the
Anglo-Irish lords were commissioned by Elizabeth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>force the new religion down the throats of the Irish people
at the point of the sword. The Liturgy, she proclaimed,
must be read in English, the mass abandoned,
and she herself be recognized as Pope in Ireland, as well
as in England. Accordingly, the English armies burned
the Catholic churches and chapels, assassinated the clergy,
and butchered the people wherever resistance was offered.
But John O’Neill was a great soldier and managed, for
many years, to defend his country with great success, defeating
the best of the English captains in several fierce
conflicts. Elizabeth, struck with his bravery and ability,
invited him to visit her at her palace of Greenwich. The
invitation was sent through Gerald of Kildare, O’Neill’s
cousin. The Irish prince accepted and proceeded to court
with a following of three hundred galloglasses, or heavy
infantry, clad in saffron-colored jackets, close-fitting pantaloons,
heavy shoes, short cloaks, and with their hair
hanging down their backs, defiant of Poynings’ Law, and
all other English enactments. They were gigantic warriors—all
more than six feet tall—and with huge mustaches,
the drooping ends of which touched their collarbones.
They also carried truculent-looking daggers and
immense battle-axes, such as might have won the admiration
of Richard Cœur de Lion himself. The English
courtiers—pigmies compared with the galloglasses—might
have been inclined to make fun of their costumes,
but those deadly appearing axes inspired awe, and no unpleasant
incident occurred during the visit. “Shane the
Proud” made a deep impression on Elizabeth, for he was
physically magnificent and as fierce as her dreaded father.
“By what right do you oppose me in Ulster?” she asked.
“By very good right, madam,” he answered. “You may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>be queen here, but I am king in Ulster, and so have been
the O’Neills for thousands of years!” Then she offered
to make him Earl of Tyrone by letters patent. “Earl
me no earls, madam,” he replied. “The O’Neill is my
title! By it I stand or fall!” There was nothing more
to be said, so the queen made him rich presents, after asking
him to be her “good friend,” which, being a gallant,
he promised, and then he went back to Ulster.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Shane, although a good general and a great
fighter, was a bad statesman, and by no means a conscientious
character. He oppressed the neighboring Irish
chiefs, being, indeed, half mad with pride, and made a
most unjust and unnecessary attack on the Clan O’Donnell,
next to the O’Neills the most powerful of Ulster
tribes. He not alone ruined the O’Donnell, but also
dishonored him, by carrying his wife away and making
her his mistress, in mad disregard of Irish public opinion.
He also quarreled with the old MacDonald colony
of Antrim—said by some writers to be Irish, not Scotch,
in their origin—and used them with extreme harshness.
In the end, his misconduct produced a revolt even among
his own followers. His enemies, including the injured
O’Donnells, speedily multiplied, and he who had been
fifty times victorious over the English, was, at last, signally
defeated by his own justly indignant fellow-countrymen.
In this extremity, he fled with his mistress and
a few followers for refuge to the MacDonalds, who, at
first, received the fugitives hospitably, but soon, instigated,
it is said, by one Captain Piers, an Englishman,
fell upon O’Neill at a banquet and stabbed him to death.
Had he loved his own people as much as he hated the
English, he might have lived and died a conqueror. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>MacDonalds did not respect the body of this dead lion.
They severed the head from the trunk, pickled it, and
sent the ghastly present to the English Lord Deputy in
Dublin, who caused it to be spiked on the tower of Dublin
Castle. O’Neill’s death, in the very prime of his military
genius, relieved Elizabeth of her most dangerous
Irish enemy. But another scion of that warrior race
was under the queen’s “protection” in London, and was
destined to raise the Bloody Hand, the cognizance of his
house, to a prouder eminence than it had attained in
Irish annals since the far-off days of Nial of the Hostages.</p>

<p class='c009'>Treacherous massacres of Irish chieftains dangerous
to England’s supremacy in their country would appear
to have been a special feature of Elizabeth’s reign.
Under the Lord Deputy Sydney’s régime, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1577,
Sir Francis Cosby, the English general commanding in
the ancient territories of Leix and Offaly, unable to obtain
the submission of the native chiefs by force of arms,
invited several hundred of them to a banquet at the rath
of Mullaghmast, in the present county of Kildare. The
principal families represented were the O’Mores, O’Nolan’s,
O’Kelly’s, and Lalors. The rath, or fort, was
fitted up for the occasion, and, through the entrance,
the unsuspecting Irish chieftains and their friends rode
with happy hearts and smiling faces. But one of
the Lalors who was rather belated, had his suspicions
aroused by the dead silence which seemed to prevail in
the rath, and by the peculiar circumstance that none of
those who had entered came out to welcome the later
arrivals. He bade the few friends who had accompanied
him to remain outside, while he entered the fort to investigate.
He took the precaution to draw his sword before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>he went in. Proceeding with caution, he was horrified
at stumbling over the dead bodies of some of his neighbors
just beyond the entrance. He retreated at once, but
was set upon by assassins placed there to murder him.
A powerful man, he wielded his blade with such good
effect that he cut his way out, mounted his horse, and
set off with his horrified associates at full gallop to his
home at Dysart. More than four hundred confiding
Irish gentlemen had entered the rath that day, and of all
of them, only the sagacious Lalor escaped. The tribe of
O’More alone lost nearly two hundred of its foremost
members, but was not entirely exterminated. Rory Oge
O’More, son of the slaughtered head of the tribe, made
relentless war on the English Pale, and never desisted
until he had more than avenged his kindred slain in the
foul massacre of Mullaghmast.</p>

    <div>The Geraldine War—Hugh O’Neill and “Red Hugh” O’Donnell</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>ULSTER was subdued, for a time, but, in Munster,
the younger branch of the Geraldines, known as
Earls of Desmond, rose against the edicts of Elizabeth
and precipitated that long, sanguinary, and dreary conflict
known as the Geraldine War. Most of the Irish
and Anglo-Irish chiefs of the southern province bore a
part in it, and it only terminated after a murderous struggle,
stretching over nearly seven years. The Desmonds
and their allies gained many successes, but lack of cohesion,
as always, produced the inevitable result—final
defeat. South Munster became a desert. Elizabeth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>armies systematically destroyed the growing crops, and,
at last, famine accomplished for England what the sword
could not have done. The Munster Geraldines were
mainly led by Sir James Fitzmaurice, a kinsman of the
earl, who was a brave man and an accomplished soldier.
The earl himself, and his brother, Sir John Fitzgerald,
had been summoned to London by the queen, and were
made prisoners and placed in the Tower, after the usual
treacherous fashion. After a period of detention, they
were transferred, as state prisoners, to Dublin Castle,
but managed to effect their escape (doubtless by the connivance
of friendly officials) on horseback and reached
their own country in due time. The earl, foolishly, held
aloof from Fitzmaurice until a dangerous crisis was
reached, when he threw himself into the struggle and,
in defence of his country and religion, lost all he possessed.
The Pope and King of Spain, in the Catholic
interest, sent men and money, but the Papal contingent,
led by an English military adventurer, named Stukley,
was diverted from its purpose, and never reached Ireland.
The Spanish force—less than a thousand men—was
brought to Ireland by Fitzmaurice himself. He had
made a pilgrimage to Spain for that purpose. Smerwick
Castle, on the Kerry coast, was their point of debarkation.
With unaccountable timidity, Earl Desmond
made no sign of an alliance, and Fitzmaurice was in
search of other succor, when he fell, in a petty encounter
with the De Burgos of Castle Connell. The Spaniards,
who occupied Smerwick, were besieged by a large Anglo-Irish
force, under the Earl of Ormond and other veteran
chiefs. They made a gallant and desperate defence, but
they were invested by land and sea, and were perfectly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>helpless against the shower of shot and shell rained upon
them night and day by the English batteries. Seeing
that further resistance was useless, the Spanish commander
finally surrendered at discretion, but, disgraceful
to relate, Lord Deputy De Grey refused quarter and the
hapless Spaniards were butchered to the last man. It
is not pleasant to have to state that among the fierce
besiegers were the celebrated Sir Walter Raleigh, the
great English poet Edmund Spenser, and Hugh O’Neill,
then serving Elizabeth, “for policy’s sake,” in a subordinate
capacity, but afterward destined to be the
most formidable of all her Irish foes. The Munster
Geraldines were exterminated, except for a few collateral
families—the Knight of Kerry, the Knight of
Glin, and some other chiefs whose titles still survive.
But the great House of Desmond vanished forever from
history, when Garret Fitzgerald, the last earl, after all
his kinsmen had fallen in the struggle, was betrayed and
murdered by a mercenary wretch, named Moriarty, in
a peasant’s hut in Kerry, not far from Castle Island.
The assassin and his brutal confederates decapitated the
remains and sent the poor old head to Elizabeth, in London,
who caused it to be spiked over the “traitor’s gate”
of the Tower. So ended the Geraldine revolt, which
raged in Munster from 1578 to 1584, until all that fair
land was a desert and a sepulchre. The bravest battle
fought during its continuance was that of Glendalough,
in the summer of 1580. This was on the soil of Leinster,
and the victory was won by the heroic Clan O’Byrne, of
Wicklow, led by the redoubtable chief, Fiach MacHugh.
The English, who were led by Lord De Grey in person,
suffered a total rout, and the Lord Deputy, at the head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>of the few terrified survivors, fled in disgrace to Dublin,
leaving behind him the dead bodies of four of his bravest
and ablest captains—Audley, Cosby, Carew, and Moore.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Carew and Audley deep had sworn the Irish foe to tame,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But thundering on their dying ear his shout of victory came;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And burns with shame De Grey’s knit brow and throbs with rage his eye,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To see his best, in wildest rout, from Erin’s clansmen fly.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The defeat and death of “Shane the Proud” had left
Ulster, temporarily, without a military chief competent
to make head against the English, and, therefore, the
Desmonds were left, practically, without help from the
northern province. Notwithstanding, the new Lord Deputy,
Perrott, kept his eyes fixed steadily on Ulster, the
fighting qualities of whose sons he knew only too well.
In Tyrconnel young Hugh Roe, or Red Hugh, O’Donnell,
was growing fast to manhood, and his fame as an
athlete, a hunter, and hater of the English, spread throughout
Ireland. Hugh O’Neill, the son of Matthew, Baron
of Dungannon, was enjoying himself at Elizabeth’s court,
where he made the acquaintance of Cecil, Essex, Bacon,
Marshal Bagnal, Mountjoy, and numerous other celebrities,
and basked in the sunshine of the royal favor, which
he took particular pains to cultivate. He was a handsome
young man, of middle size, rigidly trained to arms,
and “shaped in proportion fair.” The queen’s object was
to make him an instrument in her hands for the final
subjugation of Ireland. He seemed to enter readily into
her plans, which his quick intellect at once comprehended,
and he met her wiles with a dissimulation as profound
as her own. If any man ever outwitted Elizabeth, politically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>that man was Hugh O’Neill, whom she finally
created Earl of Tyrone—a title which, in his inmost
heart, he despised, much preferring his hereditary designation
of “The O’Neill.” But it was not Hugh’s immediate
purpose to quarrel with Elizabeth about titles, or, in
fact, anything else. He was graciously permitted to raise
a bodyguard of his own clansmen, and to arm and drill
them at his pleasure. Nay, more, the queen allowed him
to send from England shiploads of lead wherewith to
put a new roof on his castle of Dungannon. And he
went to Ireland to look after his interests in person.
Soon, rumors reached Elizabeth that O’Neill, when he
had sufficiently drilled one batch of clansmen, substituted
another; and that enough lead had been shipped by him
from England to Tyrone to roof twenty castles. It was
further rumored that the clanswomen of Tyrone were
employed casting bullets at night, instead of spinning
and weaving. O’Neill, learning of these rumors from
English friends, repaired to London, and, at once, reassured
the queen as to his “burning loyalty and devotion
to her person.” So he was permitted to return to Dungannon
unmolested. Unlike his fierce kinsman, John the
Proud, Hugh cultivated the friendship of all the Ulster
chiefs, within reach, and more particularly that of the
brave and handsome young Red Hugh O’Donnell. Nor
did he confine his friendly relations to the chiefs of Ulster.
He also perfected good understandings with many
in the other three provinces, and managed to keep on good
terms with the English also. Indeed, he did not hesitate
to take the field occasionally “in the interest of the queen,”
and, on one occasion, during a skirmish in Munster, received
a wound in the thigh. How could Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>doubt that one who shed his blood for her could be otherwise
than devoted to her service? O’Neill, no doubt,
liked the queen, but he loved Ireland and liberty much
better. In his patriotic deceit he only followed the example
set him at the English court. He kept “open
house” at Dungannon Castle for all who might choose
or chance to call. Among others, he received the wrecked
survivors of the Spanish Armada cast away on the wild
Ulster coast, and shipped them back to Spain, at his own
expense, laden with presents for their king. A kinsman,
Hugh of the Fetters—an illegitimate son of John the
Proud by the wife of O’Donnell, already mentioned—betrayed
his secret to the English Government. He explained
his action to the satisfaction of the Lord Deputy,
for he had a most persuasive tongue. Having done so,
he exercised his hereditary privilege of the chief O’Neill,
arrested Hugh of the Fetters, had him tried for treason,
and, it is said, executed him with his own hand, because
he could find no man in Tyrone willing to kill an O’Neill,
even though proven a craven traitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Deputy Perrott, in 1587, or thereabout, concocted
a plan by which he got the young O’Donnell,
whose rising fame he dreaded, into his power. A sailing-vessel,
laden with wine and other merchandise, was sent
around the coast of Ireland from Dublin and cast anchor
in Lough Swilly, at a point opposite to Rathmullen. Red
Hugh and his friends, young like himself, were engaged
in hunting and fishing when the vessel appeared in the
bay. The captain, in the friendliest manner, invited
O’Donnell and his companions on board. They consented,
and were plied with wine. By the time they were ready
to return to shore, they found the hatches battened down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>and the ship under way for Dublin. And thus, meanly
and most treacherously, was the kidnapping of this noble
youth and his friends accomplished by, supposedly, an
English gentleman.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Donnell, after a confinement of three years in Dublin
Castle, managed to effect his escape, in company with
some fellow captives. But they missed their way, and
were overtaken and captured in the territory of O’Tuhill,
at a place now called Powerscourt, in the county Wicklow.
A second attempt, made two years later on, proved
more successful, and the escaping party managed to
reach the tribe-land of the O’Byrnes, whose brave chief,
Fiach MacHugh, received and sheltered them. Art
O’Neill, one of Red Hugh’s companions, perished of
cold and hunger—the season being winter—on the trip;
and O’Donnell’s feet were so badly frozen that he was
partially disabled for life. This fact did not, however,
interfere with his warlike activity. O’Byrne at once informed
Hugh O’Neill of Red Hugh’s escape and whereabouts,
and the Ulster chief sent a guide, who brought
him safely to Dungannon, where he was royally entertained
and admitted to the knowledge of O’Neill’s secret
policy, which, as may have been surmised, aimed at the
overthrow of English rule in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>After resting sufficiently, O’Donnell proceeded to Tyrconnel,
where he was joyfully received by his people.
His father, old and unenterprising, determined to abdicate
the chieftaincy in his favor, and, accordingly, Red
Hugh was proclaimed “The O’Donnell,” with all the ancient
forms. He proceeded with characteristic rigor to
baptize his new honors in the blood of his foes. Old
Turlough O’Neill had weakly permitted an English garrison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>to occupy his castle of Strabane. O’Donnell attacked
it furiously and put all of the garrison to the
sword. He followed up this warlike blow with many
others, and soon struck terror into the hearts of all the
“Englishry” and their much more despicable Irish allies,
on the borders of Ulster and Connaught. His most active
and efficient ally in these stirring operations was
Hugh McGuire, Prince of Fermanagh—the best cavalry
commander produced by either party during the long and
devastating Elizabethan wars.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Confiscation of Desmond’s Domains—English Plantation of Munster</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THERE had been, of course, a general “confiscation
to the Crown”—that is, to the English “carpet-baggers”—of
the broad domains of the defeated Desmonds,
and their allies, and among the aliens who profited
greatly thereby, for a time, at least, were the poetic Edmund
Spenser, who obtained the castle and lands of Kilcolman,
in Cork, and Sir Walter Raleigh, who fell in for
extensive holdings in Youghal, at the mouth of the southern
Blackwater, and its neighborhood. In the garden of
Myrtle Grove House, Sir Walter’s Youghal residence,
potatoes, obtained from Virginia, were first planted in
Ireland, and the first pipeful of tobacco was smoked.
In connection with the latter event, a story is told that
a servant-girl, about to scrub the floors, seeing smoke
issuing from Sir Walter’s nose and mouth, conceived him
to be on fire, and emptied the contents of her pail over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>him, in order, as she explained, “to put him out.” Sir
Walter, we may be sure, did not relish her method of
fighting “the fire fiend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Desmond confiscation was by no means the first
case of the kind on record in Ireland. The original Geraldines
took the lands by force from the Celtic tribes,
but they speedily amalgamated with the natives, and,
within a few generations, became full-fledged Irish in
every characteristic, except their family name. Neither
was this great confiscation the last, or greatest, as will be
seen in the progress of this narrative. The queen’s ministers
caused letters to be written to the officers of every
“shire” in England, “generously” offering Desmond’s
plundered lands in fee simple—that is, practically, free of
cost—to all younger brothers, of good families, who
would undertake the plantation of Munster. Each of
these favored colonists was allowed to “plant” a certain
number of British, or Anglo-Irish, families, but it was
specifically provided that none of the native—that is, the
Celtic and Catholic and the Norman-Catholic—Irish were
to be admitted to the privilege. The country had been
made “a smoking desert” before this plantation of foreigners
was begun. Most of the rightful owners had perished
by famine and the sword, and those who still survived,
“starvation being, in some instances, too slow,
crowds of men, women, and children were sometimes
driven into buildings, which were then set on fire” (Mitchel’s
“Life of Hugh O’Neill,” page 68). “The soldiers
were particularly careful to destroy all Irish infants, ‘for,
if they were suffered to grow up, they would become
Popish rebels.’” (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 68, 69.) It is related by the
historian Lombard that “women were found hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>upon trees, with their children strangled in the mother’s
hair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And all this was done in the name of the “reformed
religion.” In good truth, although Elizabeth herself may
have wished to make the Irish people Protestant in order
that they might become more obedient to her spiritual
and temporal sway, her agents in Ireland wished for
nothing of the kind. They wished the Irish masses to
remain Catholic. Otherwise, they would have had no
good pretext for destroying them and usurping their
lands. And this, too, satisfactorily explains why, for a
very long period, the Irish national resistance to England
was considered and described as a purely Catholic,
sectarian movement. Protestantism, in the period of
which we write, meant, to the average Irish mind, England’s
policy of conquest and spoliation in Ireland. It
is hardly wonderful, therefore, that there grew up between
the followers of the old and new creeds an animosity
doubly bitter—the animosity of race supplemented by
that of religion. In our own days, we have seen the
same result in the Polish provinces of Russia and the
Turkish principalities in the Danubian region of Europe.

    <div>Conditions in Ulster Before the Revolt of O’Neill</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE first jury “trial” in Ulster was that of Hugh
Roe MacMahon, chieftain of Monaghan, who became
entangled with Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam in some
one-sided “alliance,” and, failing in some slight particular
to keep his side of the contract, was “tried” by twelve
soldiers in Elizabeth’s pay, condemned to death and shot
at his own door. This and other brutal murders, attested
by the English historian, Moryson, filled the north with
rage, and the very name of English “law” became a menace
and a terror throughout the length and breadth of
Ulster. From that bloody period dates the hatred and
distrust of English “justice” which still survives among
the Irish people. Indeed, instances of judicial murder,
almost rivaling that of MacMahon Roe, might be cited
by living Irishmen as having occurred within their own
experience. Elizabeth’s deputy, Fitzwilliam, who was a
consummate scoundrel and jobber in bribes, and would
have made a champion modern “boodle alderman,” succeeded
in making the very name of “shire,” or county,
land detested in Ireland. When he informed McGuire,
the bold chief of Fermanagh, that he was about to send
a sheriff into his “county” to “empanel juries,” the chief
answered grimly, “Let him come; but, first, let me know
his eric (price of his blood), so that, if my people should
cut off his head, I may levy it on the country.” This
was the Irish method under the Brehon law. No sheriff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>appeared in Fermanagh for many a year after McGuire’s
significant statement.</p>

<p class='c009'>Red Hugh O’Donnell continued to make things exceedingly
lively for the English garrisons in Ulster and
Connaught, and made them take to the cover of their
strong places after nearly every encounter. Near Inniskillen,
the gallant Hugh McGuire, aided by a small body
of the clansmen of Tyrone, who came “on the quiet,”
under the command of O’Neill’s brother, Cormac, met a
large English escort, who were conveying supplies to the
town, to which Red Hugh O’Donnell had laid siege, at
a ford of the river Erne. The English suffered a total
rout, and their bread-wagons having been lost in the
current, or overturned in the shallows, the spot is known
to this day as Bael-atha-an-Biscoid—in English “the Ford
of Biscuits.” Red Hugh, who had gone to Derry to
meet a body of the Antrim Scots, who were coming to
his aid, was necessarily absent when the battle was fought,
and, on hearing of the victory, remarked he was “sorry
he had not been in the fight, as he would have prevented
the escape of so many of the English.” The latter began
to perceive, by this time, that they had to “strip for the
combat” in earnest if they meant to retain their foothold
on the borders of Ulster.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rumors of O’Neill’s disaffection had again reached
the queen, and again he journeyed to London and reassured
her of his “loyalty.” He even made great show of
accepting the English title of Earl of Tyrone, and returned
to Dungannon encumbered with the gold chain
symbolical of his new “rank.” This did not please his
clansmen, who could not see into his dissembling schemes,
so he was obliged to placate them by consenting to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>installed as The O’Neill—a title he very much preferred
to his English one of Earl—at the rath of Tulloghoge
(Hill of the Youths), in his native Tyrone. Thomas
Davis, the poet of Young Ireland—a party of Irish
literary men and high-souled patriots who flourished from
1842 until 1848—in his fine ballad of the “True Irish
King,” gives a vivid picture of the scene in the following
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Unsandaled he stands on the foot-dinted rock;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Like a pillar-stone fixed against every shock.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Round, round as the rath, on a far-seeing hill,</div>

      <div class='line in1'>The graybeards are telling how chiefs by the score</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Had been crowned on the rath of the kings heretofore:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While crowded, yet ordered, within its green ring,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Are the dynasts and priests round the True Irish King.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The chronicler read him the laws of the clan,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And pledged him to bide by their blessing and ban.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>His skian and his sword are unbuckled to show</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That they only were meant for a foreigner foe;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A white willow wand has been put in his hand—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A type of pure, upright, and gentle command,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>While hierarchs are blessing, the slipper they fling</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And O’Cahan proclaims him a True Irish King.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thrice looked he to heaven with thanks and with prayer,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Thrice looked to his borders with sentinel stare—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To the waves of Lough Neagh, to the heights of Strabane;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And thrice to his allies, and thrice to his clan—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>One clash on their bucklers—one more—they are still—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What means the deep pause on the crest of the hill?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Why gaze they above him? A war eagle’s wing!</div>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis an omen—hurrah for the True Irish King!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Those who may condemn the apparently tortuous policy
of O’Neill must bear in mind that he was only practicing
against the enemies of his country the double-dealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and subtle acts they had themselves taught him,
in order to make him a more facile instrument in their
hands for that country’s subjugation. The dark and
crooked policy inculcated by Machiavelli was then in
vogue at all the European courts, and at none was it
practiced more thoroughly than at that of Elizabeth of
England. It must be admitted that the English found
in Hugh O’Neill a very apt pupil—a true case of “diamond
cut diamond.”</p>

    <div>O’Neill Draws the Sword—Victories of Clontibret and Armagh</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>MARSHAL SIR HENRY BAGNAL—one of Elizabeth’s
most potent military commanders—had
never liked Hugh O’Neill, whom he had often met in
London and Dublin, but this hatred of the Irish prince
was not shared by the marshal’s fair sister, the Lady
Mabel Bagnal, who presided over his mansion at Newry,
where were established the headquarters of the English
army in Ulster. Lady Mabel was one of the most beautiful
of women, and O’Neill, who had become a widower,
grew desperately enamored of her. He managed to elude
the vigilance of the hostile brother, and, assisted by a
friendly “Saxon,” succeeded in eloping with and making
her his wife. The elopement filled Sir Henry with fury.
He entered into a conspiracy against O’Neill with other
Englishmen and Palesmen. A new Lord Deputy had
come over from England in the person of Sir William
Russell. Charges against O’Neill were laid before him.
He communicated with the Court of London and commands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>soon came to arrest the Chief of Tyrone without
delay. O’Neill, as usual, had means of secret information
and soon knew all about the plot laid for his destruction.
Instead of being dismayed, he hastened, at once,
to Dublin and surprised his treacherous accusers in the
midst of their deliberations. His old-time friend, the
Earl of Ormond, stood by him and refused to be a party
to the treachery planned by the new Lord Deputy. When
a similar order had reached Ormond himself from Lord
Burleigh—ancestor of the late Prime Minister of
England—the earl replied scornfully in these words:
“My lord, I will never use treachery to any man, for it
would both touch her Highness’s honor and my own
credit too much; and whosoever gave the queen advice
thus to write is fitter for such base service than I am.
Saving my duty to her Majesty, I would I might have
revenge by my sword of any man that thus persuadeth
the queen to write to me.” Noble words, gallant Ormond!</p>

<p class='c009'>The earl, feeling convinced that Lord Russell, who was
not much affected by honorable scruples, would obey the
order from the queen and arrest O’Neill, advised the latter
to fly from Dublin the very night of his arrival. The
Ulster prince thought this very good advice and accepted
Ormond’s friendly offices. He managed to make his way
in safety to Dungannon and at once set about perfecting
his preparations for open warfare with the generals of
Elizabeth. The latter were not idle either, for Russell
surmised O’Neill’s intention and sent Sir John Norreys
(Norris), an experienced general, just returned from
the wars in Flanders, to command against him. The remainder
of the year 1594, as well as some of the succeeding
year, was spent in useless negotiations, for both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>parties well knew that war was now inevitable. O’Donnell,
McGuire, and some other chiefs kept up a fierce,
but rather desultory, warfare, greatly annoying the English
garrisons in the border strongholds. At last, in
the early summer of 1595, O’Neill threw off the mask,
unfurled the Red Hand of Ulster, and marched against
the Castle of Monaghan, held by the enemy. In the
midst of a siege but feebly carried on for lack of a battering
train, he heard that Norreys, with a powerful
force, was advancing northward to raise the siege.
O’Neill at once decided to anticipate his movement and
moved to Clontibret, about five miles off, and there took
post. Norreys soon appeared, and, being a hot soldier,
attacked at once. He was met with a veteran firmness
that astonished him, and both he and his brother, Sir
Thomas Norreys, were wounded in the main attack on
the Irish battle-line. At the moment when all seemed
lost for England, Colonel Segrave, an Anglo-Norman of
Meath, charged the Irish home, with a body of horse,
and, for a time, restored the battle. Segrave, himself,
rushed madly on O’Neill and the two leaders fought
hand to hand for some time, while both armies stood
still to witness the result. Mr. Mitchel thus eloquently
describes what followed: “Segrave again dashed his horse
against the chief, flung his giant frame upon his enemy,
and endeavored to unhorse him by the weight of his gauntleted
hand. O’Neill grasped him in his arms, and the
combatants rolled, in that fatal embrace, to the ground.</p>

      <div class='line in1'>Through bars of brass and triple steel.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“There was a moment’s deadly wrestle and a death
groan. The shortened sword of O’Neill was buried in
the Englishman’s groin beneath his mail. Then from
the Irish ranks rose such a wild shout of triumph as those
hills had never echoed before. The still thundercloud
burst into a tempest; those equestrian statues became as
winged demons, and with their battle-cry of Lamh-dearg-ahoo!
(‘The Red Hand to Victory’), and their long
lances poised in eastern fashion above their heads, down
swept the chivalry of Tyrone upon the astonished ranks
of the Saxon. The banner of St. George wavered and
went down before that furious charge. The English
turned their bridle-reins and fled headlong over the stream
(which they had crossed to attack the Irish), leaving the
field covered with their dead, and, worse than all, leaving
with the Irish that proud red-cross banner, the first of
their disgraces in those Ulster wars. Norreys hastily retreated
southward, and the castle of Monaghan was
yielded to O’Neill.”</p>

<p class='c009'>About the same time, Red Hugh O’Donnell “prevailed
mightily” in the west, “so that,” says Mitchel, “at the
close of the year 1595, the Irish power predominated
both in Ulster and Connaught.” O’Neill followed up
his success by laying siege to Armagh, which he captured
by an ingenious stratagem. Colonel Stafford had been
appointed to the command of the English in the old city,
and he proved himself equal to the occasion, so far as
fighting bravely to hold it went. But provisions were
running low, and it was known to Stafford that Norreys
was sending to him, from Dundalk, a large convoy of
provisions. O’Neill’s scouts had the same information,
so a body of Irish was detached to attack the convoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and capture the rations. The movement proved successful.
About three hundred English soldiers were made
prisoners. O’Neill ordered them to be stripped of their
red surtouts, and bade the same number of his clansmen
to put the garments on their own backs. Then he commanded
the convoy to march toward Armagh as if nothing
had happened. Meanwhile, he had caused his relative,
Con O’Neill, to occupy an old ruined abbey near the
main gate of the city. All this was accomplished under
cover of the night. At sunrise, Stafford and his hungry
soldiers, from the ramparts, gazed wistfully southward,
and, to their great joy, beheld, as they imagined, the convoy
marching rapidly to their relief. Almost on the instant,
it was, seemingly, attacked by the Irish army.
Volleys—blank cartridges being used—were exchanged,
and many men appeared to fall on both sides. At last,
the supposititious English seemed about to give way.
Stafford and his famished men could stand the sight
no longer. They rushed through the now open gate to
the aid of their countrymen, as they thought. To their
amazement, both red coats and saffron shirts fell upon
them, and they perceived they had been tricked. A brave
attempt was made by them to re-enter the town, but Con
O’Neill and his party, rushing from the old ruin, seized
the gate. All the English outside the walls were captured.
Soon afterward, the city itself surrendered to
the Irish leader. O’Neill made humane use of his victory.
He disarmed and paroled the English prisoners
and sent them, under safe escort, back to General Norreys.
He was a man of strict honor, and, no doubt, the
terms of the capitulation were properly observed. The
Irish dismantled Armagh, as O’Neill had no need of fortresses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>but, during his absence elsewhere, some English
made their way to the place and refortified it; only, however,
to have it retaken by the Irish army.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Ireland Still Victorious—Battles of Tyrrell’s Pass and Drumfluich</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE year 1597 witnessed the recall of Lord Deputy
Russell from the government of Ireland, and the
substitution of Lord De Burgh. A temporary truce was
entered into by the belligerents, and neither side lost any
time in augmenting its strength. All Ulster was practically
freed from English rule, but they had garrisons
shut up in the castles of Carrickfergus, Newry, Dundrum,
Carlingford, Greencastle, and Olderfleet—all on the coast.
When the truce came to an end, the Palesmen organized
a large force and prepared to send it northward, to aid
those garrisons, under young Barnewall, son of Lord
Trimleston. O’Neill detached a force of 400 men under
the brave Captain Richard Tyrrell and his lieutenant,
O’Conor, to ambush and destroy it. Tyrrell moved
promptly to accomplish his mission, and rapidly penetrated
to the present county of Westmeath. There, at a
defile now known as Tyrrell’s Pass, not far from Mullingar,
he awaited the coming of the Palesmen. In the
narrow pass, the latter could not deploy, so that the battle
was fought by the heads of columns, which gave the
advantage to the Irish. Some of the latter managed to
get on the flanks of the Palesmen, and a terrible slaughter
ensued. Of the thousand Palesmen, only Barnewall
himself and one soldier escaped the swords of the vengeful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>natives. The former was brought a prisoner to
O’Neill, who held him as a hostage, and the soldier carried
the dread news of the annihilation of the Meathian
force to Mullingar.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Lord Deputy and the Earl of Kildare, with all
the force they could muster, were in full march for Ulster.
Sir Conyers Clifford, another veteran Englishman, attempted
to join them from the side of Connaught, but
was met by Red Hugh O’Donnell and compelled to go
back the way he came, leaving many of his men behind
him. At a place called Drumfluich, the Lord Deputy and
Kildare, who were en route to recapture Portmore, which
had fallen into the hands of O’Neill, encountered the
Irish army. The latter was strongly posted on the banks
of the northern Blackwater, but the English attacked with
great resolution, drove its vanguard across the river and
took possession of Portmore. O’Neill, however, held his
main body well in hand, and while De Burgh was congratulating
himself on his success, fiercely attacked the
English who had crossed to the left bank of the river,
and inflicted on them a most disastrous defeat. The
Lord Deputy and the Earl of Kildare were both mortally
wounded, and died within a few hours. The English
army was practically destroyed. Red Hugh O’Donnell
had arrived in the nick of time to complete the victory,
and, with him, the Antrim MacDonalds, whose prowess
received due honor. The historian of Hugh O’Neill says,
succinctly: “That battlefield is called Drumfluich. It
lies about two miles westward from Blackwater-town
(built on the site of Portmore), and Battleford-bridge
marks the spot where the English reddened the river in
their flight.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>But Captain Williams, a valiant “Saxon,” held Portmore,
in spite of O’Neill’s great victory, and this fortress,
in the heart of his country, proved a thorn in the side of
Tyrone, who, as we have already mentioned, was destitute
of battering appliances for many a day. The result
at Drumfluich struck dismay into the hearts of the stoutest
soldiers of the English interest, and the dreaded names
of O’Neill and the Blackwater were on every trembling
lip throughout the Pale. The queen, in London, grew
very angry, and rated her ministers with unusual vehemence.
It was fortunate for De Burgh and Lord Kildare
that they died on the field of honor. Otherwise, they
would have been disgraced, as was General Norreys for
his defeat at Clontibret. He died of a broken heart soon
after being deprived of his command in Ulster.</p>

<p class='c009'>The English were also unfortunate in Connaught and
Munster, and when the Earl of Ormond assumed the
government of Ireland, by appointment, after the defeat
and death of De Burgh, the English interest had fallen
lower in the scale than it had been since the days of
Richard II. The earl entered into a two months’ armistice
with O’Neill, and negotiations for a permanent peace
were begun. O’Neill’s conditions were: perfect freedom
of religion not only in Ulster but throughout Ireland;
reparation for the spoil and ravage done upon the Irish
country by the garrisons of Newry and other places, and,
finally, entire and undisturbed control by the Irish chiefs
over their own territories and people. (Moryson, McGeoghegan,
and Mitchel.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Queen Elizabeth was enraged at these terms, when
transmitted to her by Ormond, and sent a list of counter-terms
which O’Neill could not possibly entertain. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>saw there was nothing for it but the edge of the sword,
and grew impatient at the tardiness of King Philip of
Spain in not sending him aid while he was prosecuting
the war for civil and religious liberty so powerfully.
The English Government, in order to discourage the
Catholic powers and keep them from coming to the aid
of Ireland, concealed or minimized O’Neill’s splendid
victories. Lombard, cited by McGeoghegan—a most conscientious
historian—avers that an English agent was
employed, at Brussels, “to publish pretended submissions,
treaties, and pardons, so that the Spanish governor
of Flanders might report to his master that the power
of the Irish Catholics was broken and their cause completely
lost.” (Mitchel.) The same charge has been
made against England in our own day—only in a different
connection. Germany, France, and Russia have semi-officially
declared that English agents at Berlin, Paris,
and St. Petersburg have persistently misrepresented the
attitude of those countries toward America during the
recent Spanish War. Whatever may have been the truth
regarding the Brussels agent, it is undeniable that King
Philip abandoned Ireland to her fate until it was too late
to hinder her ruin; and that, when Spanish troops landed
at Kinsale, in 1601, they proved more of a hindrance
than a help. O’Neill gave up all hope of assistance from
Philip in the fall of 1597 and resolved to stake all on his
genius as a commander, and on the tried valor of the
glorious clansmen of Tyrone and Tyrconnel.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Irish Victory of the Yellow Ford, Called the Bannockburn of Ireland</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WE dwell at greater length on the Elizabethan era
in Ireland than, perhaps, on any other, because
then began the really fatal turn in the fortunes of the
Irish nation. Notwithstanding splendid triumphs in the
field, cunning and treachery were fated to overcome patriotism
and heroic courage. But, before this great cloud
gloomed upon her, Ireland was still destined to witness
many days of glory, and to win her most renowned
victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>The spring and early summer of 1598 saw Captain
Williams still holding Portmore, on the Blackwater,
stubbornly for England, but his rations were nearly exhausted
and he managed to get word of his desperate
condition to Marshal Bagnal, who, at the head of a
splendidly appointed army of veteran troops, horse and
foot, marched northward from Newry to his succor.
His first operations were successful and he came very
near to capturing O’Neill himself, at a place called Mullaghbane,
not far from Armagh. Then Bagnal pushed
on to raise the siege of Portmore, where Williams was
living on his starved horses and suffering all the pangs
of hunger.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Neill, having been fully informed of Marshal Bagnal’s
progress, summoned O’Donnell and his other allies
to join him immediately, which they did. He left Portmore
to the famine-stricken garrison, and turned his face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>southward fully resolved to give battle to his redoubted
brother-in-law before he could reach the Blackwater.
Thoroughly acquainted with the character of the country
through which the English were to pass, he had no difficulty
in choosing his ground. He took post, therefore,
in the hilly, wooded, and marshy angle formed by the Callan
and Blackwater Rivers, at a point where a sluggish
rivulet runs from a large bog toward the main river, and
which is called, in the Gaelic tongue, Beal-an-atha-buidhe,
in English, “the Mouth of the Yellow Ford,” destined to
give title to the Irish Bannockburn. This field is about
two and one-half miles N.W. from Armagh.</p>

<p class='c009'>The superb English array, all glittering in steel armor
and with their arms flashing back pencils of sunlight,
Bagnal himself in the van, appeared at the opening of
the wooded pass, which, all unknown to the marshal, was
garrisoned by five hundred Irish kerns early on the sultry
morning of August 10th—T. D. McGee says the
15th—1598. The head of the column was attacked immediately
by the Celtic infantry, who, however, obedient
to orders, soon fell back on the main body, which was
drawn up behind a breastwork, in front of which was a
long trench, dug pretty deep, and concealed by wattles
(dry sticks) and fresh-cut sods—a stratagem borrowed
by O’Neill from the tactics of Bruce, so successfully put
in practice at Bannockburn, nearly three centuries before.
Having finally cleared the pass, not without copious bloodshed,
Bagnal debouched from it, and deployed his forces
on the plain in face of the Irish army. His cavalry, under
Generals Brooke, Montacute, and Fleming, shouting,
“St. George for England!” charged fiercely up to the
Irish trench, where the horses floundered in the covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>trap set for them, and then the Irish foot, leaping over
their breastwork, piked to death the unfortunate riders.
Bagnal, in no wise daunted, pressed on with his chosen
troops, animating them by shout and gesture. A part
of the Irish works, battered by his cannon, was carried,
and the English thought the battle won. They were preparing
to follow up their success when, suddenly, O’Neill
himself appeared, at the head of his main body, who had
abandoned their slight defences, and came on to meet the
English with flashing musketry and “push of pike.”
Bagnal’s artillery, with which he was well provided, did
much damage to O’Neill’s men, but nothing could withstand
the Irish charge that day. O’Donnell’s dashing
clan nobly seconded their kinsmen of Tyrone, and a most
desperate conflict ensued. Bagnal and his soldiers deported
themselves bravely, as became tried warriors, but,
in the crisis of the fight, the marshal fell, a wagon-load
of powder exploded in the English lines, their ranks became
confused, and few of their regiments preserved
their formation. The Irish cavalry destroyed utterly
what remained of the English horse. “By this time,”
says Mitchel, “the cannon were all taken; the cries of
‘St. George’ had failed or were turned to death-shrieks,
and once more, England’s royal standard sank before
the Red Hand of Tyrone.” The English rout was appalling,
and the chronicler of O’Donnell says: “They were
pursued in couples, in threes, in scores, in thirties, and in
hundreds.” At a point where the carnage was greatest,
the country people still show the traveler the Bloody
Loaming (lane) which was choked with corpses on that
day of slaughter. Two thousand five hundred English
soldiers perished in the battle and flight; and among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>fallen were the marshal, as already related, twenty-two
other superior officers, and a large number of captains,
lieutenants, and ensigns. The immediate spoils of the
victory were 12,000 gold pieces, thirty-four standards,
all the musical instruments and cannon, and an immense
booty in wagons, loaded with clothing and provisions.
The Irish army lost 200 in killed and three times that
number wounded. By O’Neill’s orders, the dead of both
sides were piously buried. (Irish annals cited by Curry
and Mitchel.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Sir Walter Scott, in his graphic poem of “Rokeby,”
which should be read by all students, as it deals with a
stirring period of English history, thus refers to the battle
of the Yellow Ford:</p>

<p class='c009'>The survivors of Bagnal’s heroic, if defeated, army,
fled to Armagh, which had again fallen into the possession
of the English, and there took shelter. O’Neill invested
the place and, being now provided with artillery,
captured from the enemy, speedily compelled its surrender.
The gallant Williams, starved out at Portmore,
also capitulated. O’Neill, with his customary magnanimity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>after depriving the prisoners of both places of their
arms, took their parole and sent them in safety to the
Pale, and, for a time, all English power whatever vanished

    <div>How O’Neill Baffled Essex—O’Donnell’s Victory of the Curlew Mountains</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE limits of this simple narrative of Irish history
will not permit us to go into the details of the numerous
“risings” of the Irish and encounters with the
disheartened English in the other three provinces. O’Donnell
swept through Connaught, like a very besom of destruction,
drove the English generals into their castles,
and other strong places, and carried Athenry by storm,
“sword in hand.” He also made a raid into Munster, and
punished a degenerate O’Brien of Inchiquin for accepting
an English title, and hugging his English chain as
“Earl of Thomond.” Then he returned to Connaught
and finished up what English garrisons still remained
there, with few exceptions. O’Neill himself also made a
visit to Munster, said his prayers at the noble shrine of
Holy Cross Abbey, on the winding Suir, and, the legitimate—according
to English notions—Earl of Desmond
being dead, set up an earl of his own. He “put heart
into” the rather slow and cautious Catholic Anglo-Normans
of this province, and caused them to join hands with
their Celtic brothers in defence of country and creed.
Under the new earl, they attacked the English with great
spirit, and, although occasionally beaten, managed to hold
the upper hand in most cases.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>In Leinster, the O’Mores, the O’Byrnes, the O’Tuhills,
and the Kavanaghs had also risen in arms, and never had
Ireland presented so united a military front, since the
first landing of the English on her shore. There was
fighting everywhere, but, outside of O’Neill and O’Donnell,
and, perhaps, the new Desmond, there would not
seem to have been a concerted military plan—probably
owing to the rather long distances between the respective
bodies and the difficulty of communication.</p>

<p class='c009'>Queen Elizabeth, when she heard of the Irish triumph
at the Yellow Ford, was violently exasperated, and
stormed against Ormond, her Lord Lieutenant, for remaining
in Leinster, skirmishing with the O’Mores and
other secondary forces, and leaving everything in the
hands of O’Neill in Ulster. She was now an aged
woman, but still vain and thirsty for admiration. Her
reigning favorite was the brilliant Robert Devereux,
Earl of Essex, who had made a reputation in the Spanish
wars. In the middle of 1599, this favored warrior,
accompanied by a picked force of at least 20,000 men,
landed in Dublin and assumed chief command. Instead
of at once moving with his fine army, reinforced by the
Palesmen and the relics of Norreys’ and Bagnal’s troops,
against O’Neill, he imitated the dilatory tactics of Ormond
and wasted away his strength in petty encounters
with the hostile tribes of Leinster and the Anglo-Irish
of Munster, most of whom sided, because of common
religious belief, with their Celtic neighbors. He also
committed the grave fault of bestowing high command
on favorites who possessed no capacity for such duties.
While marching to besiege Cahir Castle, in the present
county of Tipperary, he was obliged to pass through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>wooded defile in Leix (Queen’s County), where his rearguard
of cavalry was attacked by the fierce O’Mores and
cut to pieces. The Irish tore the white plumes from
the helmets of the fallen English troopers, as trophies,
and so great was their number that the gorge has been
called, ever since that tragical day, Bearna-na-cleite—in
English, the “Pass of Plumes.” Essex, notwithstanding
this disaster, which he made no immediate effort to
avenge, marched to Cahir and took the castle; but, in
subsequent encounters with the Munster Irish, he suffered
severe reverses. Near Croom, in Limerick, he
was met by the Geraldines and their allies and badly
defeated. Sir Thomas Norreys, Lord President of
Munster—brother of the defeated English commander
at Clontibret—was among the slain. Thus baffled, the
haughty Essex made his way sadly back to Dublin, pursued
for a whole week by the victorious Geraldines.
Smarting under his disgrace, he caused the decimation
of an English regiment that had fled from the O’Mores—something
he himself had also been in the habit of
doing. He had no heart to try conclusions with the
terrible O’Neill in his Ulster fastnesses, and sent many
letters of excuse to the queen, in which he dwelt on
the strength and courage of the Irish clansmen in war,
and asked for further reinforcements, before venturing
against O’Neill. These were sent him, to the number
of several thousand, and, at length, he seemed ready to
move. Sir Conyers Clifford, a very brave and skilful
officer, commanded for Elizabeth in Connaught. Essex
ordered him to march into Ulster and seize certain
strategic points that would open the way for the main
army when it should finally appear in the North. Clifford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>obeyed his orders with veteran promptitude. He
was soon at Boyle, in the present county of Roscommon,
where he went into camp near the beautiful abbey, whose
ruins are still the admiration of antiquarians. Thence,
he marched northward through the passes of the Corslibh,
or Curlew, Mountains, bent upon penetrating into Ulster.
But, in a heavily timbered ravine, he was fallen upon
by the fierce clansmen of Red Hugh O’Donnell, commanded
by their fiery chief in person. When the English
heard the terrible war-cry of “O’Donnell Aboo!”
“O’Donnell to Victory”) echoing along the pass, they
knew their hour had come. However, they met their
fate like brave men, worthy of their gallant commander,
and fought desperately, although in vain. They were
soon totally broken and fell in heaps under the stalwart
blows of the Clan O’Donnell. General Clifford and his
second in command, Sir Henry Ratcliffe, were killed,
and their infantry, unable to stem the tide of battle, fled
in disorder, carrying with them the cavalry, under General
Jephson, a cool commander who displayed all the
qualities of a good soldier although completely overmatched.
Had he not gallantly covered the retreat,
hardly a man of the English infantry would have reached
Boyle in safety. But the valor of Jephson did not extend
to all of his men, some of whom abandoned the field
rather precipitately. The English historian, Moryson,
excuses them on the ground that “their ammunition was
all spent.” Sligo, the key of North Connaught, fell to
O’Donnell, as one result of this sharp engagement.</p>

<p class='c009'>The defeat and death of Clifford would seem to have
utterly demoralized Essex. He again hesitated to advance
against O’Neill, and, instead of doing so, weakly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>sought a parley with his able enemy. O’Neill agreed to
the proposal, and they met near Dundalk, on the banks
of a river and in presence of their chief officers. The
Irish general, with chivalrous courtesy, spurred his
charger half-way across the stream, but Essex remained
on the opposite bank. This, however, did not prevent
the two leaders from holding a protracted conversation,
in the course of which the wily O’Neill completely outwitted
the English peer. They called five officers on both
sides into the conference, and O’Neill repeated the terms
he offered after the victory of Clontibret, in 1595. The
Englishman said he did not think them extravagant, but
his sincerity was never tested. Soon afterward, angered
by an epistolary outburst from the old queen, he threw
up his command, and returned to the London court, where
Elizabeth swore at him, ordered him under arrest, had
him tried for treason, and, finally, beheaded—the only
cruel act of her stormy life she ever repented of. The axe
that severed the head of Essex from his body left a scar
in Elizabeth’s withered heart that never healed.</p>

    <div>King Philip Sends Envoys to O’Neill—The Earl of Mountjoy Lord Deputy</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>PHILIP II of Spain died in September, 1598, and was
succeeded by his son Philip III, who, it would seem,
took more interest in the Irish struggle against Elizabeth’s
temporal and spiritual power than did his father. Philip,
in all likelihood, cared very little about Ireland’s national
aspirations, but, like all of his race, he was a zealous Catholic,
and recognized the self-evident fact that the Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>were, then, fighting not alone their own battle but also
that of the Church, with heroic vigor. O’Neill began
negotiations with the young monarch immediately after
his accession, and Philip responded by sending two envoys
to the Irish general—Don Martin de la Cerda and
the Most Rev. Matthias de Oriedo, who had been appointed
by the Pope Archbishop of Dublin—a purely
titular office, seeing that the English were in full possession
of that capital. The bishop presented O’Neill with
“a Phœnix plume,” blessed by his Holiness, and also with
22,000 pieces of gold—a generous contribution in that
age, when money was much more valuable in proportion
than it is now. (O’Sullivan, Moryson, and Mitchel.)</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Neill, having sufficiently awed the English generals
for a period, made a sort of “royal progress” through
Munster and Leinster, visiting holy places, settling feuds,
and inspecting military forces. He met with, practically,
no opposition, but, near Cork, had the misfortune to lose
his gallant cavalry commander, Hugh McGuire, chief of
Fermanagh. The latter was leading a body of horse on
a reconnoitring mission, when suddenly there appeared a
force of English cavalry, bent on a similar errand, under
Sir Warham St. Leger and Sir Henry Power, Queen’s
Commissioners, acting in place of Sir Thomas Norreys.
St. Leger rode up to McGuire and discharged a horse
pistol at close range. The heroic Irish chief reeled in
his saddle from a mortal wound, but, before falling, struck
St. Leger a crushing blow on the head with his truncheon,
and killed him on the spot. McGuire, having avenged
himself on his enemy, died on the instant. These were
the only two who fell. The English retreated to Cork
and kept within its walls until O’Neill had left the neighborhood.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The Ulster prince turned back through Ormond
and Westmeath and arrived in his own country,
“without meeting an enemy, although there was then in
Ireland a royal army amounting, after all the havoc made
in it during the past year, to 14,400 foot and 1,230 horse”—this,
too, exclusive of irregular forces. (Moryson.)
This force was well provided with artillery and all military
stores. (Mitchel.)</p>

<p class='c009'>But O’Neill’s days of almost unclouded triumph were
drawing to a close. He was, at last, about to meet an
English commander who, if not as able as himself, was
infinitely more cunning and unscrupulous. This was
Charles Blount, Earl of Mountjoy, a trained soldier, a
veteran diplomat, a fierce Protestant theologian, and a
ripe scholar. His motto, on assuming the duties of Lord
Deputy in Ireland, would seem to have been “Divide and
Conquer.” Mountjoy saw, at once, that steel alone could
not now subdue Ireland, and he was determined to resort
to other methods, more potent but less manly. About the
same time, there also came to Ireland two other famous
English generals, Sir George Carew and Sir Henry
Dowcra. The new deputy brought with him large reinforcements,
so that the English army in Ireland was more
powerful than it had ever been before; and Mountjoy’s
orders were, in effect, that Ulster, in particular, should
be honeycombed with royal garrisons, especially along
its coast-line. Although Mountjoy himself was checked,
at the outset, by O’Neill’s army, Sir Henry Dowcra, with
a powerful force, transported by sea from Carrickfergus,
occupied and fortified the hill of Derry, on the Foyle—the
ground on which now stands the storied city of Londonderry.
Other border garrisons were strengthened by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the Lord Deputy, and everything was made ready for a
vigorous prosecution of the war. The penal laws against
the Irish Catholics were softened, so as, if possible, to
detach the Anglo-Irish Catholics from the Celtic Catholic
Irish, and also to impress the weak-kneed among the latter
with “the friendly intentions of her Majesty’s government”—very
much like the court language in use to-day.
The bait took, as might have been expected—for
every good cause has its Iscariots—and we soon hear of
jealous kinsmen of the patriot chiefs “coming over to”
the queen’s “interest” and doing their utmost—the heartless
scoundrels—to divide and distract the strength of
their country, engaged in a deadly struggle for her rights
and liberty. These despicable wretches are foul blotches
on the pages of Ireland’s history. But for them, she
could have finally shaken off the English yoke, which
would have saved Ireland centuries of martyrdom and
England centuries of shame. And so we find Sir Arthur
O’Neill becoming “the queen’s O’Neill”—his branch of
the family had long been in the English interest; Connor
Roe McGuire becoming “the queen’s McGuire,” and so
on <i>ad nauseam</i>. These creatures had no love for England
or Elizabeth, but simply hoped to further their own
selfish ends by disloyalty to their chiefs and treason to
their country. We confess that this is a chapter of Irish
history from which we would gladly turn in pure disgust
did not our duty, as a writer of history, compel us to
dwell upon it yet a while longer. Dermot O’Connor, who
held a command under O’Neill’s Desmond in Munster,
yielded to the seductions of Carew and turned upon his
leader, in the interest of his brother-in-law, son of the
“great earl,” who was held as a hostage in London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Tower by Elizabeth, and was now used as a firebrand
to stir up feud and faction among the Munster Irish.
Mountjoy had not been many months in Ireland, when,
to use the words of the historian Mitchel, “a network of
English intrigue and perfidy covered the land, until the
leaders of the (Irish) confederacy in Munster knew
not whom to trust, or where they were safe from treason
and assassination.” Dermot O’Connor was willing to
surrender Desmond, whom he had kidnapped, to Mountjoy,
for a thousand pounds, but, before he could receive
his blood-money, the “Suggawn (hay-rope) Earl,” as
he was called in derision by the English faction, was
rescued by his kinsman, Pierce Lacy. But the White
Knight—frightful misnomer—another relative of the earl—was
more fortunate than O’Connor. He managed to
receive the thousand pounds, delivered Desmond to Carew,
and earned enduring infamy. The “Suggawn Earl” was
sent to London and died a miserable prisoner in the
Tower.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus, the policy of the Lord Deputy was doing its
deadly work in Munster and also in Leinster, where the
Irish were of mixed race, and where racial animosity
could be more easily worked upon than in Ulster and
Connaught, where most of the ancient clans still remained
unbroken and uncontaminated by foreign influences.
Yet Ulster and Connaught had their Benedict
Arnolds, too, as we have shown in the cases of O’Neill
and McGuire, and will show in other cases which yet remain
to be mentioned. But in these provinces the war
was national as well as religious, while in Munster it
was almost entirely religious. Most of the Catholic Anglo-Irish
would have fought with the English rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the Celtic-Irish, if their religion had been tolerated from
the first. Among the Celtic Irish chiefs who went over
to the English in Munster, were O’Sullivan More and
McCarthy More (the Great). The latter had the cowardly
excuse that his strong-minded wife had coerced him
into treason, and refused to live with him until he came
to terms with the enemy. Was there ever anything more
disgraceful in the history of manhood and womanhood?
They were, indeed, a couple entirely worthy of each other.
The Lord Deputy, in the meantime, had ravaged the “rebellious”
portions of Leinster, burning houses and crops,
and doing other evil things common to the savage warfare
of that period. His greatest piece of luck, however,
was the killing of the brave O’More of Leix in a skirmish.

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Ireland’s Fortunes Take a Bad Turn—Defeat of O’Neill and O’Donnell at Kinsale</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE English force in Ireland was now (1600-1601)
overwhelming, and as the Irish had no fleet whatever,
the English were enabled to plant garrisons, almost
wherever they wished to, around the Ulster coast, and
sometimes posts were also established in the interior of
the country. Thus Derry, Dun-na-long, Lifford, and numerous
other places held strong garrisons, and these sallied
forth at will—the small Irish army being actively
engaged elsewhere—and inflicted heavy damage on the
harmless people of the surrounding districts. The process
of crop-burning was in full blast again, and such Irish
people as escaped the sword and the halter had the horrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>vision of perishing by famine ever before their eyes.
O’Neill and O’Donnell were aware of all this, and did
the best they could, under such discouraging circumstances.
They were almost at the end of their resources,
and awaited anxiously for the aid, in men and money,
solemnly promised them by the envoy of Philip of Spain.
To add to their ever-growing embarrassment, Niall Garbh
(“the Rough”) O’Donnell, cousin of Red Hugh, and the
fiercest warrior of Clan-Conal, revolted, because of some
fancied slight, and also, no doubt, inflamed by unworthy
ambition, against the chief, and went over to the enemy.
Unfortunately, some of the clansmen, who did not look
beyond personal attachment, followed his dishonored fortunes,
but this was about the only serious case of clan
defection. The great body of the Irish galloglasses and
kerns—heavy and light infantry—remained true to
their country and their God, and died fighting for both
to the last.</p>

<p class='c009'>Niall Garbh, after allying himself with the English,
occupied the beautiful Franciscan monastery of Donegal,
in which the Annals of the Four Masters, Ireland’s chronological
history, were compiled. Red Hugh, fiercely
indignant, marched against the sacrilegious traitor and
laid siege to him in the holy place. After three months’
investment, it was taken by storm, and utterly destroyed
by fire, except for a few walls which still remain. The
traitor’s brother, Conn O’Donnell, and several of the
misguided clansmen were killed in the conflict, but, unfortunately,
Niall Garbh himself escaped, to still further
disgrace the heroic name of O’Donnell and injure the
hapless country that gave birth to such a monster.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mountjoy, after frequent indecisive skirmishes with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>O’Neill, amused himself by offering a reward of £2,000
for that chieftain’s head, and smaller amounts for those
of his most important lieutenants. But no man was
found among the faithful clansmen of Tyrone to murder
his chief for the base bribe of the Lord Deputy. Yet
Mountjoy continued to gain ground in Ulster, little by
little, and he built more forts, commanding important
passes, and garrisoned them in great force. He also
caused most of the woods to be cut away, and thus laid
the O’Neill territory wide open for a successful invasion.
O’Neill was an admirable officer, and still, assisted by
Hugh O’Donnell, presented a gallant front to Mountjoy,
but he could do little that was effective against an enemy
who had five times the number of soldiers that he had,
and could thus man important posts, filled with all the
munitions of war, without sensibly weakening his force
in the field. Destitute of foundries and powder factories,
he could make no progress in the matter of artillery,
and such cannon as he had were destitute of proper
ammunition. All this the Spaniards could have supplied,
but their characteristic dilatoriness, in the end, ruined
everything. Another circumstance also militated against
the success of the brave O’Neill—the English and their
allies were solidly unified for the destruction of the Irish,
while the latter, as we have seen, were fatally divided by
corruption, ambition, jealousy—fostered by their enemies—and
endless English intrigue. No wonder that his
broad brow grew gloomy and that his sword no longer
struck the blows it dealt so fiercely at Clontibret and the
Yellow Ford.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, however, out of the dark clouds that surrounded
his fortunes, there flashed one sun-ray of hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and joy. News suddenly reached the north, as well as
the Lord Deputy, that a Spanish fleet had landed in Kinsale
Harbor, on the coast of Cork. It carried a small
force—less than 6,000 men, mostly of poor quality—under
the command of the arrogant and incompetent Don
Juan de Aguila. He occupied Kinsale and the surrounding
forts at once, but was disappointed when the Munster
Irish—already all but crushed by Mountjoy—did not
flock at once, and in great numbers, to his standard. Of
all the Munster chiefs there responded only O’Sullivan
Beare, O’Connor Kerry, and the brave O’Driscoll. They
alone redeemed, in as far as they could, the apathy of
South Munster, and were justified in resenting the Spanish
taunt, bitterly uttered by Don Juan himself, that
“Christ had never died for such people.” The Spaniard
did not, of course, take into consideration, because he did
not know, the exhaustion of South Munster after the Geraldine
war and the wars which succeeded it. Constant
defeat is a poor tonic on which to build up a boldly aggressive
patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>The news of the landing at Kinsale reached Red Hugh
O’Donnell while he was in the act of besieging his own
castle of Donegal, surreptitiously seized by Niall Garbh,
“the Queen’s O’Donnell,” while he was absent “at the
front,” with O’Neill. He instantly raised the siege, and,
summoning all of his forces, marched southward without
an hour’s delay, as became his ardent and gallant
nature. Neither did O’Neill hesitate to abandon “the
line of the Blackwater,” which guarded his own castle
of Dungannon, to its fate, and at once marched his
forces toward Kinsale. The Clan-Conal marched
at “the route step,” through Breffni and Hy-Many,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>crossing the Shannon near where it narrows at the
east end of Lough Dearg. On through the Ormonds,
where “the heath-brown Slieve Bloom” mountains rise
in their beauty, they pressed, burning, at every footstep,
to reach Kinsale, join the Spaniards, and “have it out”
with Mountjoy and the English. O’Donnell, marching
in lighter order and by a different route, outstripped his
older confederate, but narrowly escaped being intercepted
in Tipperary by a superior English force, under
General Carew, detached by the Lord Deputy for that
purpose. As Red Hugh had no intention of giving battle
until reinforced by O’Neill, or he had joined the Spaniards,
he made a clever flank movement, by forced march,
over the Slieve Felim Hills, which interposed between
him and Limerick. But the rains had been heavy of late,
the mountain passes were boggy, and neither horses nor
carriages (wagons) could pass. Fortunately, it was the
beginning of winter, and, one night, there came a sharp
frost, which sufficiently hardened the ground, and the
Irish army, taking advantage of the kindness of Providence,
marched ahead throughout the dark hours, and,
by morning, had left Carew and his army hopelessly in
rear. O’Donnell made thirty-two miles (Irish), about
forty-two English miles, in that movement and halted
at Croom, having accomplished the greatest march, with
baggage, recorded in those hard campaigns. (Pacata
Hibernia, cited by Mitchel.)</p>

<p class='c009'>His coming among them, as well as the news of the
arrival of the Spaniards, put fresh life into the Irish of
West Munster, and, indeed, Red Hugh stood on scant
ceremony with such degenerate Irish as refused to fight
for their country, so that wherever he marched, fresh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>patriots, eager to “save their bacon,” in many cases,
sprang up like crops of mushrooms. At Castlehaven he
formed a junction with 700 newly arrived Spanish troops,
and, together, they marched toward Kinsale, which
Mountjoy and Carew were preparing to invest. O’Neill
and his brave lieutenant, Richard Tyrrell, did not pursue
the route taken by O’Donnell, but had to fight their way
through Leinster and North Munster with considerable
loss. At Bandon, in South Munster, they fell in with
O’Donnell and the Spaniards, and all marched to form an
immediate junction with De Aguila. Mitchel, quoting
from O’Sullivan’s narrative, gives the total strength of
the force under O’Neill and O’Donnell at 6,000 foot and
500 horse. The Irish leader was opposed to risking a
general engagement with so small a command, although
O’Donnell, when he beheld Mountjoy’s troops beleaguering
the town, wanted to attack, which, judging by after
events, might have been the better plan. O’Neill argued,
however, that the inclement season would soon destroy
a good part of the English soldiers and counseled delay.
O’Donnell yielded reluctantly, and then the Irish, very
badly provided, intrenched themselves and began “besieging
the besiegers.” Prudence, on this occasion, ruined
the cause of Ireland—so often ruined by rashness, before
and since; for, three days after O’Neill’s policy had been
acceded to, that is on Christmas eve, 1601, accident
brought on an engagement, in the dark, which neither
party seems to have anticipated. The tragedy is best related
by Mitchel in his life of O’Neill, thus: “Before
dawn, on the morning of the 24th (December), Sir
Richard Graham, who commanded the night guard of
horse, sent word to the deputy that the scouts had discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the matches (matchlock muskets were used at
this period) flashing in great numbers in the darkness,
and that O’Neill must be approaching the camp in force.
Instantly the troops were called to arms; messengers
were despatched to the Earl of Thomond’s quarter, with
orders to draw out his men. The deputy (Mountjoy)
now advanced to meet the Irish, whom he supposed to
be stealing on his camp, and seems to have effectually
surprised them, while endeavoring to prevent a surprise
upon himself. The infantry of O’Neill’s army retired
slowly about a mile further from the town, and made a
stand on the bank of a ford, where their position was
strengthened by a bog in flank. Wingfield, the marshal,
thought he saw some confusion in their ranks, and entreated
the deputy that he might be allowed to charge.
The Earl of Clanricarde joined the marshal and the battle
became general. O’Neill’s cavalry repeatedly drove
back both Wingfield and Clanricarde, until Sir Henry
Danvers, with Captains Taaffe and Fleming, came up to
their assistance, when, at length, the Irish infantry fell
into confusion and fled. Another body of them, under
Tyrrell, was still unbroken, and long maintained their
ground on a hill, but at length, seeing their comrades
routed, they also gave way and retreated in good order
after their main body. The northern cavalry covered the
retreat, and O’Neill and O’Donnell, by amazing personal
exertions, succeeded in preserving order and preventing
it from becoming a total rout.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was the unfortunate battle of Kinsale—the most
disastrous, perhaps, in Irish annals. It was not even well
fought, because the Irish troops, surprised in their sleep,
owing to lack of vigilance on the part of the sentinels, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>lost most of their effective arms, their baggage, and colors
at the outset. Their camp, also, came into immediate
possession of the enemy. Thus, they were discouraged—the
Irish character being mercurial, like the French—if
not badly demoralized, and they did not, in this ill-fated
action, fight with a resolution worthy of the fame they had
rightfully earned as soldiers of the first class, nor did they
faithfully respond, as heretofore, to the military genius
of their justly renowned leaders. They were mostly the
troops of Ulster, far from home, and lacking the inspiration
that comes to all men when conscious that they are
fighting to defend their own hearths against the spoiler.
Ulster, in that day, was almost alien to the southern province,
although the soldiers of both were fighting in a common
cause. Kinsale was, certainly, not a battle to which
Ireland can look back with feelings of pride, but she may
be thankful that there are few such gloomy failures recorded
in her military annals. Yet the bitter fact remains
that Kinsale clouded forever the glory achieved by the
troops of O’Neill and O’Donnell on so many fields of
victory. The Spaniards, who had joined O’Donnell on
the march, refused to fly and were almost all destroyed.
Their commander, Del Campo, two officers, and forty soldiers
were all that survived out of seven hundred men,
and they were made prisoners of war. (Mitchel.) In
a note, this author, quoting Pacata Hibernia, says: “The
most merciless of all Mountjoy’s army that day was the
Anglo-Irish and Catholic Earl of Clanricarde. He slew
twenty of the Irish with his own hand, and cried aloud
to ‘spare no rebels.’ Carew (the English general and
writer) says that ‘no man did bloody his sword more than
his lordship that day.’” This episode shows how well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Mountjoy’s policy of “Divide and Conquer” and temporary
toleration of the Catholics worked for the English
cause. Had the penal laws not been mitigated this
Anglo-Irish and Catholic Earl of Clanricarde would have
fought on the side of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Aguila, seeing that the Irish army was defeated,
and that another effort on the part of O’Neill was rendered
impossible by the loss of his munitions and the
lateness of the season, proposed to capitulate. The Earl
of Mountjoy offered him honorable terms, and De Aguila
agreed to surrender to the English all the Irish castles on
the coast to which Spanish garrisons had been admitted,
“and shortly after,” says Mitchel, “set sail for Spain, carrying
with him all his artillery, treasure, and military
stores.” Some of the Irish chiefs, notably the O’Sullivan
Beare, refused to ratify that part of De Aguila’s
capitulation which agreed to surrender their castles, occupied
by Spanish troops, to the English. The fortresses
had been thrown open to the Spaniards in good faith, and
General de Aguila had no moral right to give them up.
The most he could agree to do was to withdraw his men
from the Irish castles and take them back with him to
Spain. And this was the view taken by the Irish chiefs,
with bloody, but glorious, result, as we shall see.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Sad Death of O’Donnell in Spain—Heroic Defence of Dunboy</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>O’NEILL, when he perceived the hopelessness of the
Irish situation in Munster, conducted what remained
of his defeated army back to the north and
cantoned it along the Blackwater for the winter months,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>where he felt quite sure the English, worn out by their
exertions at the siege and battle of Kinsale, would not
attack him. Red Hugh O’Donnell, exasperated beyond
endurance at the disregard of his bold advice to attack
the beleaguering English, in conjunction with the Spaniards,
on the first arrival of the Irish army before
Kinsale, gave up the command of his clan to his brother,
Roderick, and, with a few followers, sailed for Spain,
in search of further aid. He resolved to ask King Philip
for an army, not a detachment. The chief landed at
Coruna, and was received with high honors by the Spanish
authorities. He finally reached the Spanish Court
and placed the whole Irish situation clearly before Philip,
who promised a powerful force and actually gave orders
to prepare at once for a new expedition to Ireland. The
sad sequel is well told in the eloquent words of Mitchel:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But that armament never sailed, and poor O’Donnell
never saw Ireland more; for news reached Spain, a few
months after, that Dunboy Castle, the last stronghold
in Munster that held out for King Philip, was taken,
and Beare-haven, the last harbor in the South that was
open to his ships, effectually guarded by the English;
and the Spanish preparations were countermanded; and
Red Hugh was once more on his journey to court to renew
his almost hopeless suit, and had arrived at Samancas,
two leagues from Valladolid, when he suddenly fell
sick. His gallant heart was broken and he died there
on the 10th of September, 1602. He was buried by order
of the king with royal honors, as befitted a prince of the
Kinel-Conal; and the stately city of Valladolid holds the
bones of as noble a chief and as stout a warrior as ever
bore the wand of chieftaincy or led a clan to battle.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>While we do not believe in “painting the devil blacker
than he is,” we think it proper to state here that more
recent researches would seem to have fixed the crime of
assassination on the Earl of Mountjoy. In an account,
quoted in several lectures by Frank Hugh O’Donnell,
ex-member of the British Parliament, it is definitely
stated that Red Hugh O’Donnell was poisoned at the
inn in Samancas, where he died, by a hired murderer,
named Blake, who acted for the English Lord Deputy.
Such, if the statement is true, were the political ethics
of the Elizabethan era.</p>

<p class='c009'>Donal O’Sullivan Beare, the bravest of all the Munster
leaders, wrested his castle of Dun-buidhe (Dunboy),
in English, “Yellow Fort,” from the Spaniards after De
Aguila had agreed to surrender it to the English. He
justified his conduct to the King of Spain in a pathetic
letter in which he said: “Among other places that were
neither yielded nor taken to the end that they might be
delivered to the English, Don Juan tied himself up to deliver
my castle and haven, the only key to mine inheritance,
whereupon the living of many thousand persons
doth rest, that live some twenty leagues upon the seacoast,
into the hands of my cruel, cursed, misbelieving
enemies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The defence of this castle by the Irish garrison of one
hundred and forty-three men, commanded by O’Sullivan’s
intrepid lieutenant, McGeoghegan, was one of the
finest feats of arms recorded in history. Although only
a square tower, with outworks, it held out against General
Carew, the Lord President, for fifteen days. It was
bombarded by the fleet from the haven, and battered by
artillery from the land side. Indeed, Carew had an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>army of 4,000 veteran soldiers opposed to McGeoghegan’s
143 heroes. A breach was finally effected in the castle,
but the storming parties were repeatedly repulsed. The
great hall was finally carried, and the little garrison, under
the undaunted McGeoghegan, retreated to the vaults
beneath it, where they sustained the unequal conflict for
four-and-twenty hours, and, by the exertion of unexampled
prowess, at last cleared the hall of the English.
The latter replied with an overwhelming cannonade, and
the walls of the castle crumbled about the ears of its
heroic defenders. The latter made a desperate sortie
with only forty men and all perished. The survivors in
the castle continued the defence, but, in the end, their
noble commander, McGeoghegan, was mortally wounded
and they laid down their arms. While their wounded
chief lay gasping in the agonies of approaching death,
on the floor of the vault, he saw the English enter the
place. The sight seemed to renew his life and energy.
He sprang to his feet, seized a torch, and made a rush
for an open barrel of powder, intending to blow assailants
and assailed into the sky. But an English soldier
was too quick for the dying hero. He seized him in his
arms, and a comrade wrested the torch from the failing
hand and extinguished it. Then they ran their swords
through McGeoghegan’s body, and his glorious deeds and
great sufferings were at an end. It should have been
stated that ten of the garrison, who were of the party
that made the sortie, on the failure of their bold effort,
attempted to reach the mainland by swimming across
the haven. This movement was anticipated by the English
commander. Soldiers were stationed in boats to
intercept the swimmers, and all were stabbed or shot, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>if they had been beasts of prey. The survivors of the
band of Irish Spartans, who made Dunboy forever memorable
in the annals of martial glory, were instantly
hanged by order of Carew, so that not one of the heroic
143 was left. Ruthless as he was, the Lord President
himself, in an official letter, bore this testimony to their
valor: “Not one man escaped; all were slain, executed, or
buried in the ruins, and so obstinate a defence hath not
been seen within this kingdom.” The defence of Dunboy
Castle deserves to rank in history with Thermopylæ and
the Alamo of Texas, and the butchery of its surviving
defenders, in cold blood, was a disgrace to English
manhood. How differently the gallant O’Neill treated
the English prisoners taken at Armagh, Portmore, and
other places in Ulster during the period of his amazing
victories. It is cruelties of this character that made the
English name abhorred in Ireland, not the prowess, or
even the bloodthirstiness, of the English soldiery in the
heat of battle. The massacre at Dunboy is an indelible

    <div>Wane of Irish Resistance—O’Neill Surrenders to Mountjoy at Mellifont</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WITH the fall of Dunboy, Ireland’s heroic day was
almost at an end for that generation. O’Sullivan
and some other Munster chiefs still held out, but their
efforts were only desultory. O’Neill, accompanied by
Richard Tyrrell, the faithful Anglo-Irish leader, rallied
the remnants of his clan and attempted to hold again the
line of the Blackwater. But the English were now too
many to be resisted by a handful of brave men. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>closed upon him from every side, and advanced their
posts through the country, so as to effectually cut him
off from communication with Tyrconnel, whose chief
on hearing of the death of his noble brother, Red Hugh,
in Spain, made terms with the Lord Deputy. So, also,
did many other Ulster chiefs, who conceived their cause
to be hopeless. O’Neill, still hoping against hope, and
thinking that a Spanish army might yet come to his aid,
burned his castle of Dungannon to the ground, and retired
to the wooded and mountainous portions of his ancient
principality, where he held out doggedly. But the
Lord Deputy resorted to his old policy of destroying the
growing crops, and, very soon, Tyrone, throughout its
fairest and most fertile regions, was a blackened waste.
Still the Red Hand continued to float defiantly throughout
the black winter of 1602-3; but, at length, despair
began to shadow the once bright hopes of the brave
O’Neill. His daring ally, Donal O’Sullivan Beare, having
lost all he possessed in Munster, set out at this inclement
season on a forced march from Glengariff, in
Cork, to Breffni, in Leitrim, fighting his enemies all the
way, crossing the Shannon in boats extemporized from
willows and horsehides; routing an English force, under
Colonel Malby, at the “pass of Aughrim,” in Galway,
destined to be more terribly memorable in another war
for liberty; and, finally, reached O’Ruarc’s castle, where
he was hospitably welcomed, with only a small moiety
of those who followed him from their homes,</p>

      <div class='line in2'>And pathway mile-marked with the slain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Even the iron heart of Hugh O’Neill could not maintain
its strength against conditions such as those thus
described by Moryson, the Englishman, who can not be
suspected of intensifying the horrid picture at the expense
of his own country’s reputation: “No spectacle,”
he says, “was more frequent in the ditches of towns, and
especially of wasted countries, than to see multitudes of
poor people dead, with their mouths all colored green,
by eating nettles, docks, and all things they could rend
up above ground.” There were other spectacles still
more terrible, as related by the English generals and
chroniclers themselves, but we will spare the details.
They are too horrible for the average civilized being of
this day to contemplate, although the age is by no means
lacking in examples of human savagery which go to
prove that the wild beast in the nature of man has not
yet been entirely bred out.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baffled by gold, not by steel, by the torch rather than
the sword, deprived of all his resources, deserted by his
allies, and growing old and worn in ceaseless warfare,
it can hardly be wondered at that O’Neill sent to the
Lord Deputy, at the end of February, 1603, propositions
of surrender. Mountjoy was glad to receive them—for
the vision of a possible Spanish expedition, in great force,
still disquieted him—and arranged to meet the discomfited
Irish hero at Mellifont Abbey, in Louth, where died,
centuries before, old, repentant, and despised, that faithless
wife of O’Ruarc, Prince of Breffni, whose sin first
caused the Normans to set foot in Ireland. So anxious
was Mountjoy to conclude a peace, that nearly all of
O’Neill’s stipulations were concurred in, even to the
free exercise of the Catholic religion in the subjugated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>country. He and his allies were allowed to retain, under
English “letters patent,” their original tribe-lands, with
a few exceptions in favor of the traitors who had fought
with the English against their own kindred. It was insisted,
however, by the Deputy, that all Irish titles, including
that of “The O’Neill,” should be dropped, thenceforth
and forever, and the English titles of “nobility”
substituted. All the Irish territory was converted into
“shire-ground.” The ancient Brehon Law was abolished,
and, for evermore, the Irish clans were to be governed
by English methods. Queen Elizabeth had died
during the progress of the negotiations, and a secret
knowledge of this fact no doubt influenced Mountjoy in
hurrying the treaty to its conclusion, and granting such,
comparatively, favorable conditions to Hugh O’Neill
and the other “rebellious” Irish chiefs. Therefore, it
was to the representative of King James I that Tyrone,
at last, yielded his sword—not to the general of Elizabeth.
It is said that in the bitter last moments of that
sovereign, her almost constant inquiry was: “What news
from Ireland and that rascally O’Neill?” The latter’s
most elaborate historian estimates that the long war “cost
England many millions in treasure, and the blood of tens
of thousands of her veteran soldiers, and, from the face
of Ireland, it swept nearly one-half of the entire population.”
(Mitchel.) And, he continues: “From that day
(March 30, 1603, when O’Neill surrendered at Mellifont),
the distinction of ‘Pale’ and ‘Irish country’ was at
an end; and the authority of the kings of England and
their (Anglo) Irish parliaments became, for the first
time, paramount over the whole island. The pride of ancient
Erin—the haughty struggle of Irish nationhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>against foreign institutions and the detested spirit of
English imperialism, for that time, sunk in blood and
horror, but the Irish nation is an undying essence, and
that noble struggle paused for a season, only to recommence
in other forms and on wider ground—to be renewed,
and again renewed, until—Ah! quousque, Domine,
quousque?”</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Treachery of James I to the Irish Chiefs—“The Flight of the Earls”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>AT the outset of his reign, James I, of England, and
VI of Scotland, collateral descendant of that Edward
Bruce who had been crowned King of the Irish
in the beginning of the fourteenth century, promised to
rule Ireland in a loving and paternal spirit. He had
received at his London court, with great urbanity, Hugh
O’Neill and Roderick O’Donnell, and had confirmed
them in their English titles of Earl of Tyrone and Earl
of Tyrconnel, respectively. They had accompanied
Mountjoy to England, to make their “submissions” in
due form before the king, and, while en route through
that country, were grossly insulted at many points by
the common people, who could not forget their relatives
lying dead in heaps in Irish soil, because of the prowess
of the chieftains who were now the guests of England.
It is most remarkable that the English people have always
honored and hospitably entertained the distinguished
“rebels” of all countries but Ireland. Refugees
from Poland, from Austria, from Hungary, from
France, from Italy—many of them charged with using
assassin methods—have been warmly welcomed in London,
and even protected by the courts of law, as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>case of the Orsini-infernal-machine conspirators against
Napoleon III, in 1859; but no Irish “rebel” has ever
been honored, or sheltered, or defended by the English
people, or the English courts of law; although individual
Englishmen, like Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, and a few
others of their calibre, have written and spoken in assertion
of Ireland’s right to a separate existence. Of course,
the reason is that all the other “rebels” fought in “good
causes,” and, according to English political ethics, no
cause can possibly be just in which the right of England
to govern any people whatever against their will is contested.
America learned that bitter lesson nearly two
centuries after O’Neill and O’Donnell were hooted and
stoned by the English populace for having dared to defend
the rights and the patrimony of their people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Catholic religion continued to be tolerated by
James until 1605, when, suddenly, a penal statute of
the time of Elizabeth was unearthed and put into operation
with full force. Treaty obligations of England
with the Irish chiefs were also systematically violated.
The lands of Ulster were broad and fair, and the great
body of military adventurers who had come into Ireland
from England during the long wars of the preceding
reign, were greedy for spoil. These and the Irish traitors—Art
O’Neill, Niall Garbh O’Donnell, the false McGuire,
and the rest—pestered the government and made
never-ending charges of plots and “treasons” against
“the earls,” as the Irish leaders of the late war now came
to be called. The plotters were ably assisted by Robert
Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, ancestor of the late Marquis
of Salisbury, who was also his namesake. Another able
English conspirator against the Irish chiefs was Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Arthur Chichester, who became one of the chief beneficiaries
of the subsequent “confiscations,” and whose
descendants still hold, as “titled nobility,” a very comfortable
slice of ancient Ulster. Some “Reformed” bishops
also took great interest in getting the earls into hot
water with the government. Finally an alleged plot on
the part of O’Neill and O’Donnell to overthrow the
King of England’s government in Ulster—an absurdity
on its face, considering their fallen and helpless condition—was
made the pretext for summoning them to appear
before the English courts established in Ireland, in
whose justice they had no confidence, remembering the
ghastly fate of MacMahon Roe. A hired perjurer,
named O’Cahan—the unworthy scion of a noble house—was
to be chief “witness” against O’Neill, and no
secret was made of the fact that others would be forthcoming,
hired by Chichester, to finish the work begun
by the principal informer. Meanwhile the free exercise
of the Catholic religion—so solemnly guaranteed by
Mountjoy—was strictly prohibited, under the penal enactment
of Elizabeth, known as the “Act of Uniformity,”
already referred to; and again began those horrid
religious persecutions, for politics’ and plunder’s sake,
which had no termination in Ireland, except for one
brief period, during nearly two centuries. Such Catholics
as desired to practice their faith had to betake themselves
to the mountain recesses, or the caves of the seacoast,
where, before rude altars, Mass was celebrated by
priests on whose heads a penal price was set. Sheriffs
and judges, attended by large bands of soldiers, made
circuit of the new Ulster “counties” and succeeded in
completely terrifying the unfortunate Catholic inhabitants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Education, as far as Catholics were concerned,
was prohibited, and then began that exodus of Irish
ecclesiastical students to the Continent of Europe, which
continued down to the reign of William IV, notwithstanding
the partial mitigation of the penal laws,
in the reign of his father, and the passage of the
Catholic Emancipation Bill during his brother’s reign,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1829.</p>

<p class='c009'>The persecuted earls clearly saw there was no hope of
peace for them in Ireland, and that their presence only
wrought further ill to their faithful clansmen, now reduced,
for the first time, to the condition of “subjects” of
the King of England. Lord Howth, a powerful Catholic
noble of the Pale, was suspected of having given information
to the Lord Deputy of a meeting held at Maynooth
the previous Christmas at which the earls and several
Anglo-Catholic noblemen were present. It was
claimed that the enforcement of the Act of Uniformity
was there discussed, and that another effort to overthrow
the English power would be made by the parties to the
meeting. This “plot,” if there were any at all, was communicated
to the Clerk of the Privy Council by an
anonymous letter dropped at the Castle of Dublin in
March, 1607. “O’Neill,” says McGee, “was with Chichester,
at Slane, in September when he received a letter
from the McGuire—not the traitor of that title—who
had been abroad, conveying some startling information
upon which Tyrone seems to have acted at once. He took
leave of the Lord Deputy, as if to prepare for a journey
to London, whither he had been summoned on some false
pretext; and, after spending a few days with his old
friend, Sir Garrett Moore, at Mellifont, repaired to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>seat of Dungannon, where he, at once, assembled all of
his immediate family and all proceeded to the shores of
Lough Swilly, at Rathmullen, where they were joined by
Roderick O’Donnell and all of his household. They embarked
immediately on the French ship which had conveyed
McGuire to Ireland, and set sail for France, where,
on landing, they were warmly welcomed and royally entertained
by the chivalric King Henry IV, who, as became
a stout soldier and able captain, greatly admired the
prowess displayed in the Ulster wars by Hugh O’Neill.
There sailed to France with the latter his last countess,
daughter of McGenniss of Iveagh; his three sons, Hugh,
John, and Brian; his nephew, Art O’Neill, son of Cormac,
and many of lesser note. With O’Donnell sailed his
brother Cathbar; his fair sister, Nuala, wife of Niall
Garbh, who had, in righteous indignation, forsaken the
traitor when he drew the sword against Ireland and
her noble brother, Red Hugh; the lady Rose O’Doherty,
wife of Cathbar, and, after his death, of Owen O’Neill;
McGuire, Owen MacWard, the chief bard of Tyrconnel,
and several others. It proved to be a fatal voyage, for
it exiled forever the best and bravest of the Irish chiefs.
Well might the Four Masters in their Annals of the succeeding
generation say: “Woe to the heart that meditated,
woe to the mind that conceived, woe to the council
that decided on the project of voyage, without knowing
whether they should to the end of their lives be able to
return to their ancient principalities and patrimonies.”
And, adds the graphic Mitchel, “with gloomy looks and
sad forebodings, the clansmen of Tyrconnel gazed upon
that fatal ship, ‘built in the eclipse and rigged with curses
dark,’ as she dropped down Lough Swilly, and was hidden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>behind the cliffs of Fanad Head. They never saw their
chieftains more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything was now settled in Ulster, for the English
interest, except for the brief “rebellion” of Sir Cahir
O’Doherty, the young chief of Inishowen, who fell out
with Sir George Powlett of Derry, and flew at once to
arms. He made a brave struggle of some months’ duration,
but, as no aid reached him from any outside quarter,
he was speedily penned up in his own small territory, and,
fighting to the last, died the death of a soldier—the noblest
death he could have died, surrounded by the armies
of Marshal Wingfield and Sir Oliver Lambert, on the
rock of Doon, near Kilmacrenan, in August, 1608. Thus
went out the last spark of Ulster valor for a generation.</p>

<p class='c009'>King James, having used Niall Garbh O’Donnell for
all he was worth to the English cause, grew tired of his
importunities and had him conveyed to England, under
guard, together with his two sons. All three were imprisoned
in the Tower of London from which the traitor,
at least, never emerged again. He met a fate he richly
merited. Cormac O’Neill, the brave captor of Armagh,
and the legitimate O’Cahan, both of whom had incurred
the hatred of Chichester, also perished in the same gloomy
prison.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now all that remained to be done was to parcel
out the lands of the conquered Ultonians and others of
“the Meer Irish” between the captains of the new conquest.
Chichester was given the whole of O’Doherty’s
country, the peninsula of Inishowen, and to this was
added O’Neill’s former borough of Dungannon, with
1,300 acres of valuable land in the neighborhood of
the town. Wingfield was created Lord Powerscourt and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>obtained the beautiful district of Fercullen, near Dublin—one
of the most charming domains in all Europe.
Lambert became Earl of Cavan and had several rich estates,
including that of Carrig, bestowed upon him in addition.
All the counties of Ulster were declared forfeited
to the Crown of England. The primate and other Protestant
prelates of Ulster claimed, and received, 43,000
acres. Trinity College, Dublin, received 30,000 acres, in
Tyrone, Derry, and Armagh, together with six advowsons,
or Church beneficies, in each county. The various
guilds, or trades, of the city of London, England, obtained
the gross amount of 209,800 acres, including the
city of Derry, to which the name of “London” was then
prefixed. Grants to individuals were divided into three
classes of 2,000, 1,500, and 1,000 acres each. Catholic
laborers were required to take the oath of supremacy—acknowledging
King James as spiritual head of the
Church—which they, notwithstanding all their misfortunes,
nobly refused to do. In the end, seeing that the
fields would remain uncultivated for the most part, the
English and Scotch “undertakers,” or settlers, for prudence’
sake, rather than from liberal motives, practically
made this tyrannical requirement a dead letter. But the
Catholic tillers of the soil were driven from the fertile
plains and forced to cultivate miserable patches of land
in the bogs or on the mountains. When these became in
any degree valuable, an exorbitant “rent” was charged,
and the poor Catholics, utterly unable to pay it, were
again compelled to move to some even more unpromising
location, where the same procedure again and again produced
the same wretched result.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was thus that the ancient Irish clans, and families,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>were actually robbed, in spite of solemn treaties and royal
pledges, of their rightful inheritance, and that strangers
and “soulless corporations” became lords of their soil.
It was the beginning, in Ulster at least, of that system
of “felonious landlordism” which is the curse of all Ireland,
in spite of recent remedial measures, even in this
day. So, too, began that English garrison in Ireland—pitting
race against race and creed against creed—which
has divided, distracted, and demoralized the Irish nation
ever since. The “Plantation of Ulster” was the most
fatal measure ever carried into effect by English policy
in Ireland. Some of the Irish princes did not long survive
their exile. From France they had proceeded to
Rome and were very kindly received by the Pontiff, who
placed residences commensurate with their rank and fame
at their disposal. Roderick O’Donnell died in the Eternal
City in July, 1608. McGuire died at Genoa, while
en route to Spain in August, and, in September, Cathbar
O’Donnell also passed away, and was laid in the same
grave with his gallant brother, on St. Peter’s Hill. (McGee.)
O’Neill’s fate was sadder still. The historian
just quoted says of him: “He survived his comrades
as he did his fortunes, and, like another Belisarius, blind
and old, and a pensioner on the bounty of strangers, he
lived on eight weary years in Rome.” Death came to his
relief, according to a historian of his own period, in 1616,
when he must have been over seventy years of age. He
sleeps his last sleep amid the consecrated dust of ages,
beneath the flagstones of the convent of St. Isidore; and
there, in the words of the Irish orator and American general,
Meagher, “the fiery hand that rent the ensign of St.
George on the plains of Ulster has mouldered into dust.”</p>

    <div>Confiscations and Penal Laws—The Iron Rule of Lord Strafford</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE first Anglo-Irish Parliament held within a period
of twenty-seven years was summoned to meet
in Dublin on May 18, 1613, and, notwithstanding the
Act of Uniformity, it would appear that quite a large
number of Catholics, styled in the language of the times
“recusants,” because of their opposition to the spiritual
supremacy of the king, were elected to serve in that body.
They would have had a majority but for the creation of
some forty “boroughs,” each entitled to a member, under
the patronage of some Protestant peer. This was
the beginning of that “rotten borough” system which
finally led to the abolition of the sectarian Irish Parliament
of after times. Scenes of great disorder occurred
in this Parliament of 1613, chiefly occasioned by the intolerant,
and even violent, proceedings of the anti-Catholic
party, unreasonable bigots, having an eye to the main
chance in the matter of confiscated property, to whom the
presence of any “Papist” in that body was as gall and
wormwood. This bitter prejudice led finally to the utter
exclusion of all Catholics from the Anglo-Irish Parliament,
and even the few Catholic commoners previously
entitled to a vote were deprived of that privilege, or
rather right, until the last decade of the eighteenth century.
Still, the Catholic minority in the Parliament of
1613 succeeded in preventing ultra-tyrannical legislation,
and, really, made the first stand for the constitutional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>rights of Ireland, from the colonial standpoint.
It was finally adjourned in October, 1615, and no other
Parliament was called to meet in Ireland until 1635,
when Charles I had already been ten years on the throne.
“Government,” meanwhile, had been carried on arbitrarily,
without constitutional restraint of any kind, as
under the Tudor sovereigns—only with far less ability.
The Tudors, at least—particularly Henry and Elizabeth—were
intellectual tyrants, which their immediate successors
were not. Never was so shameful a system of
public spoliation carried out as in the reigns of James I,
and his equally despotic, and still more unscrupulous, son
Charles I. The viceroy was not responsible to any power
whatever, except that of the English monarch. Chichester
was succeeded by Lord Grandison, and under his
régime the infamous “Commission for the Discovery
of Defective Titles” was organized, of which the surveyor-general,
Sir William Parsons, ancestor of the Earls
of Rosse, was the head. This Commission, “aided
by a horde of clerkly spies, employed under the name of
Discoverers (McGee), ransacked Old Irish tenures in
the archives of Dublin and London with such good effect,
that in a very short time 66,000 acres in Wicklow and
385,000 acres in Leitrim, Longford, the Meaths, and
Kings and Queens Counties were ‘found by inquisition
to be vested in the crown.’ The means employed by the
Commissioners in some cases to elicit such evidence as
they required were of the most revolting description. In
the Wicklow case, courts-martial were held, before which
unwilling witnesses were tried on charge of treason, and
some actually put to death. Archer, one of the number,
had his flesh burned with red-hot iron, and was placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>on a gridiron over a charcoal fire till he offered to testify
anything that was necessary. Yet on evidence so obtained,
whole counties and towns were declared forfeited
to the crown.” (<i>Ibid.</i>) Is it any wonder, therefore,
that a people so scourged, plundered, and degraded
should cherish in their hearts fierce thoughts of reprisal
when opportunity offered? These wholesale land robberies
were not confined to the Celtic Irish alone, but
were practiced on all Irishmen, of whatever descent, who
professed the Catholic faith. Add to these the bitter
memories of the murder and persecution of many bishops
and innumerable priests and communicants of that faith,
and the only wonder is that the Irish Catholic people of
the seventeenth, and most of the succeeding, century, retained
any of the milder and nobler characteristics of the
human family. They were stripped of their property,
education, civil rights, and, in short, of all that makes
life worth living, including freedom of conscience—that
dearest privilege of a people naturally idealistic and devotional.
The idea of religious toleration never seems
to have entered into the minds of what may be called
the “professional Protestant” ascendency, except, as we
have seen, for purposes of diplomacy which tended to
weaken and divide Irish national opposition to foreign
rule. In addition to the grievances we have enumerated,
the office of Master of Wards was bestowed upon Sir
William Parsons, and thus “the minor heirs of all the
Catholic proprietors were placed, both as to, person and
property, at the absolute disposal of one of the most intense
anti-Catholic bigots that ever appeared on the
scene of Irish affairs.” (McGee.) This was one of the
pernicious influences that, not for conscience’ sake, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for sordid gain, changed the religion of so many of the
ancient families of Ireland from the old to the new form
of belief; and no English policy was more bitterly resented
and vengefully remembered by the Irish Catholic
masses. And because of this dishonest system of proselytizing,
carried on by one process or another from the
period of the Reformation to the reign of Victoria, the
Irish Catholic peasant has associated “conversion” of
any of his neighbors to the Protestant belief with personal
degradation. The Irish Catholic peasant has no
feeling but that of utter contempt and aversion for a
“turn-coat” Catholic; but he is most liberal in his feelings
toward all Protestants “to the manor born,” as has
been frequently and emphatically manifested by his choice
of Protestant leaders, from Grattan to Parnell. Whatever
of religious bigotry may linger in the warm heart
of the Catholic peasant may be justly charged to outrageous
misgovernment, not to his natural disposition, which,
in the main, is both loving and charitable. The faults
we can trace in the Irish character to-day are partially
those of human nature, which averages much the same
in all civilized peoples, but many of them, and the gravest,
can be attributed, without undue prejudice, to the
odious penal laws which were sufficient to distort the
characteristics of angels, not to speak of mortal men.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charles I, of England, was a thorough Stuart in
despotic character, wavering policy, base ingratitude, and
fatuous obstinacy. His reign was to furnish to Ireland
one of the most consummate tyrants and highway robbers
that ever cursed a country with his cruelty and
greed. This moral monster was the infamous Thomas
Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, whose “tiger jaws” closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>on the unfortunate country with the grip of a dragon.
This dishonorable “noble” counseled King Charles to
commit an act of moral delinquency which, in our day,
would be rightly, if coarsely, called “a confidence game.”
The Irish Catholics, in convention assembled, had drawn
up a sort of Bill of Rights, which they urged the king
to confirm, and agreed to pay into the royal treasury
the sum of £100,000, which they could ill spare, to show
their “loyalty,” and also, no doubt, to influence Charles,
who, like all of his family, dearly loved money, to grant
“the graces” prayed for. Strafford advised the base king
to take the money, but to manage matters so that the
concessions he had solemnly promised should never go
into effect! And the ignominious Stuart actually acted
on the advice of this ignoble mentor. And so the poor
Irish Catholic “gentry” lost both their money and their
“concessions.” When we read this chapter of Irish
history, we are tempted to feel less sympathy for the
fate of Charles I, who was afterward sold to Cromwell
and the English Parliament by the Scottish mercenary
army of General Leslie, with which the king had taken
shelter, for back pay, amounting to £200,000 (see Sir
Walter Scott’s “Tales of a Grandfather”). This miserable
monarch so far degraded himself, further, as to cause
writs for the election of a Parliament to grant the Catholic
claims issued in Ireland, but privately instructed Lord
Falkland to have the documents informally prepared, so
that the election might prove invalid; and, meanwhile,
his Lords Justices went on confiscating Catholic property
in Ireland and persecuting prelates, priests, and
people almost as savagely as in the worst days of Mountjoy
and Chichester. Strafford came to Ireland as Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Deputy in July, 1633, and entered at once on his “thorough”
policy, as he called it; and, to prepare himself
for the task he had set himself to perform, he through
the “Lords Justices” extracted a “voluntary contribution”
of £20,000 additional out of the terrorized Catholic
“nobility and gentry” of the “sister” island, who, no
doubt, wrung it, in turn, out of the sweat of the faces
of their peasant retainers. But this was a mere bagatelle
to what followed. He compelled Ireland to pay subsidies
to the amount of £200,000 in 1634, and imposed
£100,000 more in the succeeding year. He carried the
war of wholesale confiscation into Connaught, and compelled
grand juries, specially “packed” for the work, to
give the King of England title to the three great counties
of Mayo, Sligo, and Roscommon. The grand jury of
Galway County refused to return such a verdict. They
were summoned to the court of the Castle Chamber in
Dublin, and sentenced to pay a fine of £4,000 each to
the crown. The sheriff who empaneled them was fined
£1,000. (McGee.) The very lawyers who pleaded for
the actual proprietors were stripped of their gowns; “the
sheriff died in prison and the work of spoliation proceeded.”
(<i>Ibid.</i>) Similar, if not quite so general, robberies
went on in Kildare, Kilkenny, Cork, and other
counties. It must be said, however, that Strafford was,
in a manner, impartial, and robbed, his master granting
full approval, without distinction of creed. We can not
help feeling thankful that the London companies which
swallowed, in the reign of King James, the lands of
Tyrone and Tyrconnel, were compelled by “Black
Tom,” as the earl was nicknamed, to pay £70,000 “for
the use of the king.” Out of all this plunder, and much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>more beside, Strafford was enabled to maintain in Ireland
10,000 infantry and 1,000 excellently equipped
horse, “for the service of his royal master.” When this
great robber visited London in 1639, fresh from his
crimes in Ireland, the king, on whom so much ill-deserved
sympathy has been wasted, assured him, in person,
that his actions in Ireland had his (Charles’) “most
cordial approval” (McGee), and even urged the earl to
“proceed fearlessly in the same course.” To still further
mark his approbation of Strafford’s policy, the king promoted
him to the rank of Viceroy of Ireland. Strafford
took the king at his word and did proceed so fearlessly
in Ireland that his name of terror has been overshadowed
in that country by only one other—that of Oliver Cromwell.
Every Parliament called to meet by the tyrant in
the conquered country—for so the earl regarded Ireland—was
used simply as an instrument wherewith to extort
still more tribute from the impoverished Irish people.
This terrible despot, having accomplished his deadly
mission in Ireland, returned to England and there, as
before, became chief adviser to the weak and wicked
monarch. He counseled the latter to ignore, as far as
he dared, the action of Parliament, and was imprudent
enough to remark that he (Strafford) had an army in
Ireland to support the royal will. He was, soon afterward,
impeached by the House of Commons, led by
stern John Pym, for treasonable acts in seeking to change
the constitutional form of the English Government.
This method of procedure was abandoned, however, and
Parliament passed a bill of attainder, to which the “false,
fleeting, perjured” Charles, frightened by popular clamor,
which accused himself of being implicated in a plot to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>admit soldiers to the Tower for the rescue of Strafford,
gave the “royal assent.” The earl, on learning this,
placed a hand upon his heart and exclaimed, “Put not
your trust in Princes!” And thus the master he had but
too faithfully served consigned Strafford to the block.
He was beheaded on Tower Hill, May 12, 1641. When
the hour of his similar doom approached, nearly eight
years thereafter, Charles said that the only act of his
reign he repented of was giving his assent to the bill
which deprived his favorite minister of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some Irish historians, McGee of the number, claim
that, outside of his land robberies and tributary exactions,
the Earl of Strafford made an able ruler of Ireland,
and that trade and commerce flourished under his
sway. While this may be, to a certain extent, true,
nothing can palliate the crimes against justice and liberty
of which he was guilty. He was only a degree less
contemptible than the treacherous master who finally betrayed
and abandoned him.</p>

    <div>Irish Military Exiles—Rory O’More Organizes a Great Insurrection</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>SINCE Sir Cahir O’Doherty fell on the rock of Doon,
in 1608, no Irish chief or clan had risen against the
English interest throughout the length and breadth of
the island. The masses of the Irish people had, apparently,
sunk into a condition of political torpor, but the
fires of former generations still smouldered amid the
ashes of vanquished hopes, and needed but a breath of
inspiration to fan them into fierce, rebellious flame. Most
of the ancient Celtic and many of the Anglo-Norman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>families of Catholic persuasion had military representatives
in nearly all the camps of Europe. One Irish
legion served in the army of Philip III of Spain, and was
commanded successively by two of the sons of Hugh
O’Neill, victor of the Yellow Ford—Henry and John. In
it also served the hero’s gallant nephew, Owen Roe
O’Neill, who rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and
made a brilliant defence of Arras in France, besieged by
Marshal de Meilleraye, in 1640. Of this able soldier we
shall hear more in the future. The English Government
never lost sight of those Irish exiles, and, about this time,
one of its emissaries on the Continent reported that there
were in the Spanish Netherlands alone “twenty Irish
officers fit to be colonels and a hundred fit to be captains.”
The same agent reported, further, that the Irish military
throughout Europe had long been procuring arms for an
attempt upon Ireland, and had 6,000 stand laid up in
Antwerp for that design, and that these had been bought
out of the deduction of their “monthly pay.” At the defence
of Louvain against the French, the Irish legion,
1,000 strong, commanded by Colonel Preston, of a distinguished
Anglo-Irish family, received honorable mention,
and again at the capture of Breda. These are only
a few of the stirring events abroad which raised the martial
reputation of the Irish people in the eyes of all Europe,
and the fame of those exploits, reaching Ireland
by means of adventurous recruiting officers or courageous
priests, who defied the penal laws and all their terrors,
found a responsive echo in many a humble home, where
the hope of one day throwing off the foreign yoke was
fondly cherished. The exiled priesthood, many of whose
members became prelates of high rank abroad, aided the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>sentiment of the military at the Catholic courts, and thus
was prepared the way for the breaking out of the great
insurrection of 1641, which, but for the foolish over-confidence
of an Irish chief and the dastardly treason
of an obscure drunkard, might have been gloriously
successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moving spirit in the new project was Roger, or
Rory O’More, of the ancient family of Leix, who had
been educated in Spain and was, virtually, brought up at
the Spanish court, in company with the sons of Hugh
O’Neill, of Tyrone. O’More would seem to have been
a born organizer, and a man of consummate tact and discretion.
It is a pity that but little is known of his early
career, and, indeed, the precise time of his return to Ireland
remains an unsettled question, but it is certain that
he returned quietly there, and took up his residence, without
parade, on his estate of Ballynagh in Leinster. He
never appeared in Dublin, or any other populous centre,
unless on some public occasion, that would be sure to attract
the attendance of the principal men of the country.
Thus, during the Parliamentary session of 1640, we are
told by McGee and other Irish annalists, he took lodgings
in Dublin, and succeeded in drawing into his plan
for a general insurrection, Connor McGuire, MacMahon,
Philip O’Reilly, Turlough O’Neill, and other prominent
gentlemen of Ulster. He made a habit, also, of visiting
the different towns in which courts of assize were
being held, and there becoming acquainted with influential
men, to whom, after due sounding, he outlined his
plans for the final overthrow of the English government
in Ireland, and the restoration to the Irish people of the
lands and rights of which they had been robbed. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>one of these tours, we are told, he made the acquaintance
of Sir Phelim O’Neill, of Kinnaird, in Tyrone—head of
the branch of that great family still tolerated by the ascendency
Sir Connor MCGennis of Down, Colonel
Hugh MacMahon of Monaghan, and the Right Rev.
Heber MacMahon, Administrator of Clogher, by connivance
or toleration, for, during the penal laws, there
was no “legal” recognition of a Catholic prelacy, although,
under Charles I, especially about this period,
there was no very rigid enforcement of the Act of Uniformity,
probably because the king and government had
enough trouble on their hands in vainly trying to force
Protestant episcopacy on the Scotch covenanters.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’More did not confine his operations exclusively to
Ulster. He also made a tour of Connaught, with his
usual success; for he was a man of fine person, handsome
countenance, and courtly manners. Tradition still
preserves his memory green among the Irish people of all
classes. He was equally courteous to the lord and to
the peasant. In the castles and mansions of the aristocracy
he was ever the favored guest, and he charmed all
his entertainers with the brilliancy of his conversational
powers and the versatility of his knowledge. Among
the poor, he was looked upon as “some glorious guardian
angel,” who had come as a messenger from the God of
Freedom to rid them of their galling chains. It is a
singular fact that, although he must have taken thousands,
high and low, into his confidence, not a man seems
to have betrayed him to the Castle Government, which
remained in profound ignorance of his plot until the very
eve of insurrection. Robert Emmet, in after times, practiced
the methods of O’More, but with far less wisdom,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>although influenced by the same lofty principles of patriotism.</p>

<p class='c009'>The records of the times in which he lived do not
show that O’More went extensively into Munster, but
he did excellent missionary work among the Anglo-Catholic
nobles of his own native province of Leinster. He
found them, as a majority, very lukewarm toward his
project, influenced, no doubt, by fears of the consequences
to themselves should the contemplated revolution prove
abortive. Although not a trained soldier, O’More had
keen military foresight. The army raised by Strafford
in Ireland was mainly made up of Catholics—for he does
not seem to have discriminated very much in the matter
of creed—and these troops were, in consequence, regarded
with distrust, and even intense hatred, by the people of
England, to whom the very name of Catholic was, in
those days, odious. The vacillating king, influenced by
the prejudices of his English subjects, resolved to get rid
of his Irish army, and gave such of the regiments as
might so elect permission to enter the service of Spain.
Some did volunteer, but O’More prevailed on many of
the officers to keep their battalions together, and thus
secured the nucleus of a well-trained military force at the
very outset of hostilities. Among the influential Irish
officers who acted on O’More’s suggestion were Colonel
Plunket, Colonel Sir James Dillon, Colonel Byrne, and
Captain Fox. These, with O’More, constituted the first
Directory of the Irish Confederates of Leinster. Meanwhile
active communication was kept up with their friends
on the Continent, and emissaries were coming and going
all the time between the two organizations. The head
of the movement abroad appears to have been John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>O’Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who, however, died suddenly—some
writers aver by the hand of a poisoner—early in
1641; and the military exiles immediately transferred
their allegiance to his cousin, Colonel Owen Roe O’Neill,
with whom we have already made acquaintance. It was
agreed among the allies that the uprising for Irish liberty
should occur about the 1st of November, and October
23, 1641, was finally decided upon as the fateful
day. The date was made known to only the most trusted
chiefs of the projected insurrection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Everything appeared to prosper with the plans of the
patriots until the actual eve of the rising. On that night
(October 22), as fate would have it, there dined with
Colonel Hugh MacMahon—to whom was intrusted the
command of 200 picked men who were to surprise the
Castle—several Irish officers concerned in the conspiracy.
Among the guests was one Owen O’Connolly, an unworthy
creature for whom MacMahon would appear to
have entertained an unaccountable friendship. According
to tradition, O’Connolly remained with Colonel MacMahon
after the other guests had gone to their several
abodes, and, in a moment of inexcusable weakness, the
unhappy host, who must have been rendered reckless
by wine, confided to his traitor-guest the secret so momentous
to Ireland. O’Connolly was more than half
intoxicated, but, unknown to MacMahon, he was in the
service of a strong government supporter, named Sir
John Clotworthy, and the danger which menaced his
patron made the fellow sober enough to outwit his foolish
informant. In order to divert suspicion, he pretended,
after a time, that he wished to retire, and left
his sword in MacMahon’s room. He managed to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the rear door of the lodgings, and made his way over
all kinds of obstacles, in the dark, to the castle, where,
after much trouble, he succeeded in getting audience of
Sir William Parsons, to whom he related what Colonel
MacMahon had revealed to him. Parsons, observing
that O’Connolly was still under the influence of strong
drink, at first refused to believe him; and was on the
point of turning him out of doors, when something in
the rascal’s earnestness made him pause and consider.
As a result of his musing, he sent for his colleague,
Sir John Borlaise, Master of the Ordnance; the latter
immediately advised the summoning of the council. Several
members of that body soon appeared, and the deposition
of the informer was formally taken. A squad
of soldiers surrounded MacMahon’s lodgings and captured
him. Lord McGuire was also taken, but Colonels
Plunket and O’Byrne, Rory O’Moore, and Captain Fox,
who were also in the city, succeeded in making good
their escape. MacMahon, on being arraigned before the
Privy Council in the Castle, at daylight on the memorable
23d, defiantly acknowledged his share in the plot, and
declared that it was then too late for the power of man
to prevent the revolution. He showed great courage, as
did also his colleague, Lord McGuire, but MacMahon’s
bravery could have been much better spared than his discretion,
the want of which sent himself and his companion
in misfortune to the scaffold, and, undoubtedly,
lost to Ireland the best chance she had ever had of severing
the connection with Great Britain. This unhappy
result teaches a harsh, but useful, political lesson: Never
to confide a secret that concerns a great cause to a dubious
“hanger-on,” and to avoid the cup that inebriates when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>one is the possessor of such a secret, or whether one is or
not. O’Connolly’s treachery was rewarded by a grant of
lands from “the crown,” and he was afterward a colonel
in Cromwell’s army. His ultimate fate is involved in
obscurity. But his name is embalmed in the annals of
enduring infamy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lords Justices of England, in Dublin, once made
aware of the situation, lost no time in putting the Castle
and city at large in a posture of defence. The guards
were doubled and reinforcements were summoned, by
special messengers, from neighboring garrisons. Two
tried soldiers were invested with the military power—Sir
John Willoughby, who had been Governor of Galway,
assumed command of the Castle; and Sir Charles
Coote—one of the blackest names in Irish annals—was
made military governor of the city. The Earl of Ormond—afterward
Duke—was summoned from Carrick-on-Suir
to assume chief command of the royal army.
Thus, the Irish capital was again preserved, through folly
and treason, to the English interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>MacMahon made no vain boast before the Privy Council,
when he declared that the rising was beyond the
power of man to prevent. Ulster did its full duty, and,
on the morning of October 23, the forts of Mountjoy
and Charlemont and the town and castle of Dungannon
were in the hands of Sir Phelim O’Neill or his chief
officers. Sir Connor MacGennis captured Newry; the
MacMahons took Carrickmacross and Castleblaney, the
O’Hanlon’s, Tandragee, while O’Reilly and McGuire—a
relative of the lord of that name—“raised” Cavan and
Femanagh. (McGee.) Rory O’More supplemented a
brief address of the northern chiefs, wherein they declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>they bore no hostility to the king, or to his English
or Scotch subjects, “but only for the defence and
liberty of themselves and the native Irish of the kingdom,”
with one more elaborate, in which he ably showed
that a common danger threatened the Protestants of the
Episcopal Church with Roman Catholics. In all the
manifestos of the time, there was entirely too much
profession of “loyalty” to a king who was constitutionally
incapacitated for keeping faith with any body of
men whatsoever. Never was the adage that “Politics
makes strange bedfellows” more forcibly illustrated than
during this period of Irish history. The manliest of all
the declarations issued was that of Sir Connor MacGennis,
from “Newry’s captured towers.” “We are in
arms,” wrote he, “for our lives and liberties. We desire
no blood to be shed, but if you (the English and
their allies) mean to shed our blood, be sure we shall be
as ready as you for that purpose.”</p>

    <div>Horrors of Civil War in Ulster—Battle of Kilrush—Rory O’More Disappears from History</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>AT first the civil war in Ulster—for in the main it was
the Old Irish against the Anglo-Irish settlers of the
Elizabethan régime, or their immediate descendants—was
carried on without ferocity, but the Scottish garrison
of Carrickfergus, in the winter of 1641, raided Island Magee,
in the neighborhood, and put to the sword or drove
over the cliffs, to perish in the breakers beneath them,
or be dashed to pieces on the rocks, 3,000 of the Celtic-Catholic
inhabitants, without regard to age or sex. Protestant
historians claim that acts of cruelty had been committed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>on the Anglo-Irish settlers by the Celtic Irish before
this terrible massacre was accomplished. There may
have been some isolated cases of murder and rapine—for
bad and cruel men are to be found in all armies—but
nothing that called for the wholesale slaughter at Island
Magee by fanatical Scottish Covenanters, who made up
a majority of the Carrickfergus garrison. Christians, not
to mention Mohammedans and savage heathens, have
shed oceans of blood in fierce persecution of each other,
as if they were serving a furious devil, rather than a merciful
God. They forget, in their unreasoning hatred, that
the gentle Messiah, whose teachings they profess to follow,
never made the sword the ally of the Cross. The
man made mad by religious bigotry is a wild beast, no
matter what creed he may profess. Let us, as Americans,
be thankful that we live under a government which recognizes
the equal rights of all the creeds, and permits
every citizen to worship God in peace, after his own fashion.
May the day never come when it shall be different
in this Republic!</p>

<p class='c009'>The frightful event we have chronicled naturally
aroused the worst passions of the angered Catholic population
of Ulster, and some cruel reprisals resulted. We
are sorry to be obliged to state that credible history
ascribes most of the violence committed on the Irish side
to Sir Phelim O’Neill; but no charge of the kind is made
against O’More, MacGennis, McGuire, Plunket, O’Byrne,
or any of the other noted chiefs of the period. It is impossible
to arrive at any accurate statement of the number
of those who perished on both sides, outside of the numerous
battlefields of the long struggle; but it is certain
they have been grossly exaggerated, particularly by English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>writers, who took for granted every wild statement
made at the period. But, even granting that all the
charges made were true, which, of course, we do not admit,
the fact would not stamp the charge of cruelty on the
Irish nation. It was an age of cruelty—the age of the
Thirty Years’ War in Germany, which gave to the world
the horrors of the sack of Magdeburgh; the age of the
wars of the Fronde in France, and almost that of the
Spanish atrocities in the Netherlands. And Cromwell
was soon to appear upon the scene in Ireland, to leave
behind him a name more terrible than that of Tilly in
Germany or of Alva in the Low Countries. In fact, in
the seventeenth century, Europe, from east to west, was
just emerging from Middle-Age barbarism, and Ireland,
most likely, was neither better nor worse than most of
her sister states. We love and respect the Irish race, but
we do not believe in painting it whiter than it is. The
nation, plundered and outraged, was goaded to madness,
and whatever crimes were committed under such circumstances
may well be attributed to the workings of temporary
insanity. It is, however, regrettable that around the
history of the Irish insurrection of 1641 there should
linger blood-red clouds, which even the lapse of two and
a half centuries has not been able to dissipate.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the Anglo-Irish side of the conflict, the name of
Sir Charles Coote stands out in bloody pre-eminence.
Like Sir Phelim, he had the grand virtue of physical
courage—he feared nothing in mortal shape—but in all
else he was a demon-brute, and his memory is still execrated
throughout the length and breadth of the land
he scourged with scorpions. His soldiers are accused
of having impaled Irish infants on their pikes—their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>mothers having been dishonored and butchered—without
rebuke from their inhuman commander. On the
contrary, McGee, a very painstaking and impartial historian,
quotes Sir Charles Coote as saying that “he
liked such frolics.” (McGee’s “History of Ireland,”
Volume I, p. 502.) It is not unpleasant to note that,
after a career of the most aggressive cruelty, he was
finally killed by a musket-shot during a petty skirmish
in the County Meath, and it is popular belief that the shot
was fired by one of his own band of uniformed assassins.</p>

<p class='c009'>The war proceeded in a rather desultory manner,
chiefly because of lack of skill in the Irish generals—only
a few of whom had seen service—and the promised Irish
military leaders had not yet sailed from the Continent.
Sir Phelim O’Neill made an unsuccessful attack on Drogheda,
and was also repulsed at other fortified places, owing
to the lack of a suitable battering train. English reinforcements
kept pouring into Dublin by the shipload,
until a fine army of not less than 25,000 men, with a
numerous and well-served artillery, was in the field. The
Irish army amounted, nominally, to 30,000 men, but only
a third of it was armed and properly trained.</p>

<p class='c009'>The excesses of the English army in the peaceful Anglo-Catholic
districts of Leinster aroused the resentment
of the hitherto apathetic nobility and “gentry” of that
fine province. They appointed Sir John Read to bear a
protest to the king, but, while en route, he was arrested,
confined in Dublin Castle and put to the rack by the Parliamentary
Government. Even this outrage did not drive
the aristocrats of Leinster into immediate warfare. Other
outrages followed in quick succession. Finally, Lord
Gormanstown called a meeting of the Catholic peers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>gentlemen to assemble at the hill of Crofty, in the County
Meath. They met there accordingly, headed by the
caller of the gathering. Other distinguished Palesmen
present were the Earl of Fingal, Lords Dunsany, Louth,
Slane, Trimleston, and Netterville; Sir Christopher Bellew,
Sir Patrick Barnewall, Nicholas Darcy, Gerald Aylmer,
and many others. While these personages were still
deliberating, they observed a group of horsemen, bearing
arms, approaching at a rapid pace. They were attended
by a guard of musketeers, and proved to be the insurgent
chiefs of Roger O’More, Philip O’Reilly, Costello MacMahon,
Captains Byrne and Fox, and other leaders of
the people. The party on the hill immediately galloped
on horseback to meet them, and Lord Gormanstown, in
loud and stern tones, asked: “Who are you, and why come
you armed into the Pale?” To this question O’More replied:
“We represent the persecuted people of the Catholic
faith, and we come here for the assertion of the liberty
of conscience, the maintenance of the royal prerogative,
which we understand to be abridged, and the making of
the subjects in this Kingdom of Ireland as free as those
of England.” “Then,” replied Gormanstown, “seeing
that these be your true end and object, we will likewise
join with you!” The leaders on both sides then joined
hands, amid the applause of their followers. A more
formal meeting was arranged for at the hill of Tara, and
at that gathering, held the next month, the alliance was
formally concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The faulty training of the Irish army was painfully illustrated
soon afterward, when the forces of the newly
made allies encountered those of Lord Ormond at a place
called Kilrush, near the town of Athy, in Kildare, April
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>13, 1642. The numbers were about equal—perhaps
7,000 men each. The Irish were commanded by a brave
but inexperienced officer, Lord Mountgarret, and with
him were Lords Dunboyne and Ikerrin, Rory O’More,
Colonel Hugh O’Byrne, and Sir Morgan Kavanagh.
Mountgarret failed to occupy in time a difficult pass
through which Ormond must march on his way to Dublin,
and this failure compelled him to rearrange his plan
of battle. Confusion—as is always the case when this
experiment is tried with raw soldiers—resulted. The
Irish fought bravely for a time, but were soon outmanœuvred
and outflanked. The Anglo-Irish cavalry took
them in reverse. Colonel Kavanagh, fighting desperately
at the head of his regiment, met a hero’s death.
His fall discouraged his troops, who broke and fled to a
neighboring bog, whither the hostile cavalry could not
safely pursue them. The other Irish troops, surrounded
on all sides, made a rush for the morass also, broke
through the enemy’s ranks and joined their vanquished
comrades. On the Irish side, 700 officers and men fell
in this untoward affair. The loss of the Anglo-Irish
was much smaller, and Ormond was enabled to proceed
in a species of triumph to Dublin, where the news of
his victory preceded his arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is passing strange that, after the battle of Kilrush,
the great organizer of the insurrection, Roger O’More,
is heard of never more in his country’s troubled annals.
All accounts agree that, during the combat, he acted his
part like a true soldier, but he failed to reappear in the
Irish ranks during subsequent conflicts. His was certainly
a mysterious and unaccountable disappearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The late Rev. C. P. Meehan, author of “The Confederation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of Kilkenny,” who gave more attention to that
period of his country’s story than any other writer, says,
on page 26 of his interesting work: “After the battle of
Kilrush, one bright name disappears [he mentions
O’More in a foot-note]; the last time the inspiriting
war-shout of his followers fell on his ear was on that
hillside. What reasons there may have been for the retirement
of the gallant chief, whose name was linked with
that of God and Our Lady, are not apparent; but it is said,
upon authority, that he proceeded to Ferns, and devoted
the rest of his days to peaceful pursuits in the bosom of
his family.” The historian Coote says that he died at
Kilkenny. This was, surely, a “lame and impotent conclusion”
to such a career. The defeat of his countrymen
may have destroyed his hopes, or he may have had reason
to doubt the loyalty of his allies of the Pale. We are
inclined to believe an old Leinster tradition, which says
that he died of a broken heart immediately after the lost
battle, on which he had built such high hopes. Such a
spirit as his could not have remained inactive during the
nine long years of the struggle, inaugurated by himself,
which followed the disaster at Kilrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>We can not dismiss this extraordinary man from our
pages without quoting the following introduction to a
ballad dealing with his career in Edward Hayes’s remarkable
collection of poetry, called “The Ballads of
Ireland,” vol. I, page 173:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roger, or Rory, O’More, is one of the most honored
and stainless names in Irish annals. Writers who
concur in nothing else agree in representing him as a
man of the loftiest motives and the most passionate patriotism.
In 1640, when Ireland was weakened by defeat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and confiscation, and guarded with a jealous care, constantly
increasing in strictness and severity, O’More,
then a private gentleman with no resources beyond his
intellect and courage, conceived the vast design of rescuing
her from England, and accomplished it. In three
years England did not retain a city in the island but
Dublin and Drogheda. For eight years her power was
merely nominal, the land was possessed and the supreme
authority exercised by the Confederation created by
O’More. History contains no stricter instance of the
influence of an individual mind. Before the insurrection
broke out the people had learned to know and
expect their Deliverer, and it became a popular proverb,
and the burden of national songs, that the hope of Ireland
was in ‘God, the Virgin, and Rory O’More.’ It
is remarkable that O’More, in whose courage and resources
the great insurrection had its birth, was a descendant
of the chieftains of Leix, massacred by English
troops at Mullaghmast a century before. But if he took
a great revenge, it was a magnanimous one. None of
the excesses which stained the first rising in Ulster is
charged upon him. On the contrary, when he joined the
northern army, the excesses ceased, and strict discipline
was established, as far as it was possible, among men
unaccustomed to control, and wild with wrongs and sufferings.”
Says De Vere, in his sadly beautiful dirge,
which assumes that the great leader died in 1642, as the
people of Leinster have been taught to believe—</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Proceedings of the Confederation of Kilkenny—Arrival of Owen Roe O’Neill and Rinuccini</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>OUT of the chaos of a popular uprising, and a number
of minor councils, which could decide only for
localities, there sprang into existence the National Synod,
composed of clerics and laymen of the Catholic persuasion,
because, at this period, few, if any of the Irish
Protestants were in sympathy with the insurrection, or
revolution, which is a more fitting term. The “oath
of association” was formulated by the venerable Bishop
Rothe, and, somewhat unnecessarily, seeing that the
King of England was using all the forces at his disposal
to crush “the rebellion,” pledged true faith and allegiance
to Charles I and his lawful successors. The fundamental
laws of Ireland and the “free exercise of the Roman
Catholic faith and religion” were to be maintained. Then
came the second, and most important, part of the solemn
and, as some thought, stringent obligation, which bound
all Confederate Catholics never to accept or submit to
any peace without the consent and approbation of their
own general assembly.</p>

<p class='c009'>A constitution was framed which declared the war
just and constitutional, condemned racial distinctions
such as “New” and “Old” Irish, ordained an elective
council for each of the four provinces, and a national
council for the whole kingdom, condemned, as excommunicate,
all who might violate the oath of association,
or who should be guilty of murder, assault, cruelty, or
plunder under cover of the war.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>The bishops and priests, very wisely, decided that a
layman should be elected president of the National Council,
and Lord Mountgarret was so chosen, with Richard
Belling, lawyer and litterateur, as secretary. Both were
men of moderate opinion and free from any taint of
prejudice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was decided that the Supreme, or National, Council
should hold its first session in the city of Kilkenny on
October 23, 1642, the anniversary of the rising; and “the
choice of such a date,” says McGee, “by men of Mountgarret’s
and Belling’s moderation and judgment, six
months after the date of the alleged ‘massacre,’ would
form another proof, if any were now needed, that none
of the alleged atrocities (of 1641) were yet associated
with that particular day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Between the adjournment of the National Synod, in
May, and the meeting of the Council in October, many
stirring events occurred. The confederate general in
Munster, the aged Barry, made an unsuccessful attempt
to capture Cork, but had better success at Limerick, which
surrendered to the Irish army on June 21. Soon afterward
the Anglo-Irish leader, General St. Ledger, died at
Cork, and the command devolved upon Murrough
O’Brien, Baron of Inchiquin, who had been brought up
from an early age as one of Parsons’ chancery wards,
and had, therefore, become a Protestant. Furthermore,
he had grown to be an anti-Irish Irishman of the blackest
and bloodiest type. In Irish history, he is known as
“Black Murrough the Burner,” because the torch, under
his brutal sway, kept steady company with the sword,
and both were rarely idle. He served the king as long as
the royal policy suited his views, but, when it did not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>his services were at the disposal of the opposition. Murrough
had served his military apprenticeship under Sir
Charles Coote and was a past master in all the cruelties
practiced by his infamous instructor. The curse of the
renegade was strong upon him, for he hated his own kin
more bitterly than if he were an alien and a Briton. Of
the ancient royal houses of Ireland, those of MacMurrough
and O’Brien present the strongest contrasts of
good and evil.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish forces succeeded in taking the castles of
Loughgar and Askeaton, but Inchiquin inflicted a severe
defeat upon them at Liscarroll, where the loss was nearly
a thousand men on the side of Ireland, whereas the victor
boasted that there fell only a score on his side. There
were also some skirmishes in Connaught, where the peculiar
inactivity of Lord Clanricarde produced discontent,
and led to a popular outbreak in the town of Galway
which General Willoughby speedily suppressed, with every
circumstance of savage brutality. Affairs in Leinster
continued rather tranquil. Ormond was raised by the
king to the dignity of marquis, but does not seem to have
been trusted by the Puritan Lords Justices, Parsons and
Borlaise. The fall of the year was signalized, however,
by the landing in Ireland of three able generals, all of
whom fought on the national side—Right Hon. James
Touchet, Earl of Castlehaven, who had been imprisoned
as a suspect in Dublin Castle, but managed to effect his
escape; Colonel Thomas Preston, the heroic defender
of Louvain, who debarked at Wexford, bringing with
him 500 officers of experience, several siege guns, a few
light field-pieces, and a limited quantity of small arms;
and last, but most welcome to Ireland, arrived from Spain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Colonel Owen Roe O’Neill, who made a landing on the
Donegal coast with 100 officers, a company of Irish veterans,
and a quantity of muskets and ammunition. He
immediately proceeded to the fort of Charlemont, held
by his fierce kinsman, Sir Phelim O’Neill, who, with
commendable patriotic self-sacrifice, resigned to him, unsolicited,
the command of the Irish army of the North,
and became, instead of generalissimo, “President of
Ulster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Simultaneously with the arrival of Owen Roe, General
Lord Leven came into Ireland from Scotland with 10,000
Puritan soldiers. He had met O’Neill in the foreign
wars and expressed publicly his surprise that he should
be “engaged in so bad a cause”—to which Owen replied
that he had a much better right to come to the rescue of
Ireland, his native country, than Lord Leven had to
march into England against his acknowledged monarch.
Leven did not remain long in Ireland, and the command
of his troops fell to General Monroe—a brave but slow
man, on whom the advice of his predecessor to act with
vigor was thrown away. Monroe’s dilatory tactics enabled
O’Neill, who had wonderful talent for military organization,
to recruit, drill, and equip a formidable force,
mainly made up of the men of Tyrone and Donegal—as
fine a body of troops as Ireland had ever summoned to her
defence. The valorous clansmen were speedily molded
into a military machine by their redoubted chief, who
set the example of activity to all of his command.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Supreme Council of the Irish Confederation
met in Kilkenny, according to agreement, one of its
most important acts was the appointing of generals to
command in the several provinces. It named Owen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>O’Neill commander-in-chief in Ulster, General Sir
Thomas Preston in Leinster, General Barry in Munster,
and General Sir John Burke in Connaught. Fighting
was resumed with vigor. Preston met with alternate
successes and reverses in his province, but, on the whole,
came out victorious. Barry and his lieutenants did brilliant
work in Munster, and routed both Vavassour and
Inchiquin. O’Neill played a Fabian game in Ulster,
training his army in partial engagements with the enemy
and husbanding his resources for some great occasion,
which, he saw, would surely come. But the brightest
laurels of the campaign were gathered by General Sir
John Burke, who, after other brilliant exploits, compelled
General Willoughby to surrender the city of Galway to
the Irish forces on June 20, 1643; and the national flag
waved from the tower of its citadel until the last shot of
the war was fired nine years thereafter. Clanricarde,
who could have had the command in chief, paltered with
time, and thus lost the opportunity of linking his name
with a glorious exploit.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the Irish armies, and particularly that under
O’Neill, occupied excellent strategic positions, and the
hopes of the military chiefs and the nation rose high
when, suddenly, there came a blight upon those hopes in
the shape of a cessation of hostilities—in other words, a
prolonged armistice—agreed to between the Anglo-Catholic
majority in the National Council on the one side,
and the Marquis of Ormond, representing the King of
England, on the other. The Anglo-Catholics were again
duped by pretences of liberality toward their religion, as
their fathers had been in the days of Elizabeth; and this
ill-considered truce wrested from Ireland all the advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>won in the war—which had already lasted two years—by
the ability of her generals and the courage of her
troops. Vain was the protest of O’Neill, of Preston, of
Burke, of Barry, of the Papal Nuncio, of the majority
of the Irish nation. Charles was in straits in England,
fighting the Parliamentary forces arrayed against his
acts of despotism, and Ormond promised everything in
order to end the war in Ireland, temporarily at least, and
so be enabled to send needed succor to a sovereign whom
he loved and served much better than he did God and
country. With incredible fatuity, the Anglo-Catholic
majority in the National Council listened to the voice of
Ormond, and voted men and money to support the cause
of the bad king who had let Strafford loose upon Ireland!
We are glad to be able to say that the “Old Irish”
element, represented by the brave and able O’Neill, was
in nowise responsible for this act of weakness and folly.
O’Neill saw into futurity, and frightful must have been
that vision to the patriot-hero, for it included the horrors
of Drogheda and Wexford, where the thirsty sword of
Cromwell bitterly avenged on Ireland the foolish and
fatal “truce of Castlemartin”; another lesson to nations,
if indeed another were needed, to avoid mixing up in
the quarrels of their neighbors. Ireland invited ruin on
that dark day when she voted to draw the sword for the
ungrateful Charles Stuart against the Parliament of England.
The temporary concession of Catholic privileges—designed
to be withdrawn when victory perched on the
royal banner—was poor compensation for the loss of
advantages gained at the price of the blood of brave
men, and the sowing of a wind of vengeance which produced
the Cromwellian whirlwind. If King Charles had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>ever done a fair or manly act by Ireland—even by the
Anglo-Catholics of Ireland—the folly of that country
might be, in a measure, excusable, but his whole policy
had been, on the contrary, cold-blooded, double-faced,
and thoroughly ungrateful. In this instance, the Anglo-Irish
Catholics brought all their subsequent misfortunes
on themselves. As if to emphasize its imbecility, the
National Council placed Lord Castlehaven, an English
Catholic, in supreme command over O’Neill in Ulster.
Owen Roe was, of course, disgusted, but was also too
good a soldier and too zealous a patriot to resign his
command and go back to Spain, as a man of less noble
nature might have done. Meanwhile, Monroe and his
army of 10,000 Lowland Scotch and Ulster “Undertakers”
kept gathering like a thundercloud in the north. In
Scotland a body of 3,000 Antrim Irish, under Alister
MacDonald, called Cal-Kitto, or “the Left-handed,” were
covering themselves with glory, fighting under the great
Marquis of Montrose in the unworthy royal cause. And
we read that the Irish Confederate treasury, about this
time, is somewhat replenished by funds sent from Spain
and Rome. Even the great Cardinal Richelieu, of France,
to show his sympathy with Ireland, invited Con, the last
surviving son of the great O’Neill, to the French court,
and permitted the shipment of much needed cannon to
Ireland. But all of those good foreign friends of the
Irish cause were sickened and discouraged by the miserable
policy of armistice, so blindly consented to by the
lukewarm “Marchmen of the Pale” who had assembled
in Kilkenny.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many Irish Protestants, particularly the High Church
element, were ardent royalists and refused to take the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>oath of the Covenanters prescribed in Ulster by General
Monroe. They were driven with violence from their
homes, and many fled for succor to their Catholic
brethren, who treated them with hospitable consideration.
In Munster, the ferocious Inchiquin, and still
more savage Lord Broghill, son of Boyle, first Earl of
Cork, foiled in their ambitious schemes by some royal
refusal, broke out most violently, pretending the armistice
was violated, and seized upon three leading Southern
towns—Cork, Kinsale, and Youghal, where their excesses
were too horrible for narration—murder and arson
being among the lightest of their crimes. Ormond, in
his peculiarly adroit way, succeeded in still further prolonging
the truce, and stated that he had power from
the king to come to a permanent agreement with the
Confederates. The cause of Ireland about this time lost
a true and ardent friend and champion in the death of
the good Pope Urban VIII, who was succeeded by Innocent
X—a Pontiff whose noble generosity is still gratefully
remembered by the Irish nation. It was to one of
their worthy predecessors, in the time of the Elizabethan
wars, O’Donnell’s bard referred, when addressing Ireland,
in allegorical fashion, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O! my dark Rosaleen!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Do not sigh, do not weep—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The priests are on the ocean green—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>They march along the deep!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>There’s wine from the Royal Pope,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Upon the ocean green,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Spanish ale to give you hope,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My dark Rosaleen!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Nathless the truce, those two bad Irishmen, Inchiquin
and Broghill, continued to do base work in the South,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>where their cold-blooded atrocities struck terror into the
wretched people of Munster. They even corrupted old
Lord Esmond, commandant of Duncannon fort, which
partly commanded the important harbor of Waterford
from the Wexford side. Esmond was blind and almost
senile, and, perhaps, too, was terrorized by the brutal
threats of Inchiquin. But Lord Castlehaven and the
Confederate Irish immediately laid siege to the place,
and, after ten weeks of beleaguerment, succeeded in retaking
it. The traitorous commandant perished in the
assault, and thus escaped an ignominious death, which
his crime had richly merited. Several other Munster
towns, held by Inchiquin and his officers, were successively
attacked and taken by the Confederates. In Connaught,
however, the latter met with serious reverses.
The town of Sligo was captured by Sir Charles Coote,
Jr.—a worse scourge than even his infamous father—and,
in an attempt to recover it, several gallant Irishmen
perished. Archbishop O’Healy, of Tuam, fell into the
hands of Coote and was barbarously tortured to death,
Sunday, October 26, 1645. It must be remembered that
these hostilities were the work of the Parliamentary
forces, which were opposed by the “Old Irish” party.
The royal troops had been sent to England to assist
Charles, or else lay supine in their garrisons, as did
also the Anglo-Irish, waiting for further developments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The king sent the Earl of Glamorgan, an English
Catholic, who had intermarried with the O’Brien family,
to Ireland to negotiate a new treaty with the Confederates.
He succeeded in having a preliminary document
drawn up, signed by himself for Charles, and by Lord
Mountgarret and Muskerry on behalf of the Confederates.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>Ormond, with his customary dilatoriness, haggled
over the provisions regarding toleration of the Catholic
Church in the kingdom, and thus frittered away much
valuable time, which the Parliamentary forces made
good use of. Ormond caused the treaty to be greatly
modified, and while the negotiators were working on
it at Kilkenny, there arrived in Ireland a new Papal
Nuncio, in the person of the famous John Baptist Rinuccini,
Archbishop of Ferns, and, afterward, Cardinal. He
came to represent Pope Innocent X, who sent also substantial
aid. The Irish in exile and their friends sent,
through Father Luke Wadding, a further contribution
of $36,000. The Nuncio complained that he had been
unreasonably detained in France—it was greatly suspected
by the intrigues of Cardinal Mazarin, who had
succeeded Richelieu, Ireland’s true friend. In spite of
this trickery, however, he managed to purchase, with
Pope Innocent’s funds, a 26-gun frigate, which he called
the <i>San Pietro</i>, 2,000 muskets, 2,000 cartridge boxes,
4,000 swords, 2,000 pike-heads, 800 horse pistols, 20,000
pounds of powder, and other much needed supplies.
(McGee.) A ludicrous cause of one of his delays in
France was the obstinacy of the wife of Charles I, Henrietta
Maria, daughter of Henry of Navarre, who insisted
that she would not receive the Papal Nuncio unless
he uncovered in her presence. Rinuccini was proud and
fiery, and, as representing the Pope, declined to remove
his biretta, which so angered the queen that, after six
weeks’ parleying on this point of etiquette, the pair separated
without coming to an interview. Such is the
farcical folly of “royal minds.”</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Treason of Ormond to the Catholic Cause—Owen Roe O’Neill, Aided by the Nuncio, Prepares to Fight</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Papal Nuncio, although only in the prime of life,
was in feeble health, and had to be borne on a litter
by relays of able-bodied men, from his landing-place, at
Kenmare in Kerry, to the city of Limerick, where he was
received with all the ceremony due to his high rank, noble
character, and chivalrous mission. From Limerick he
proceeded by the same mode of conveyance to Kilkenny,
the Confederate capital, where honors almost regal in
their splendor awaited him. Lord Mountgarret, President
of the National Council—a veteran soldier who had
participated in the wars of Hugh O’Neill against Elizabeth—met
the Papal dignitary, surrounded by a guard
of honor, composed of the youthful chivalry of the Confederation,
in the picture gallery of the Castle of Kilkenny—the
palatial residence of the Duke of Ormond,
the most politic nobleman of the age. The so-called
Glamorgan treaty proceeded smoothly enough until certain
demands of the exiled English Catholics, made
through the Nuncio, were included in its provisions.
Armed with the amended parchment, Glamorgan and the
representatives of the Confederates returned to Dublin
and laid the matter before Ormond. The latter acted in
so strange a manner as to take the Confederate delegates
completely by surprise. He had Glamorgan arrested
while at dinner, on charge of having exceeded his instructions,
and threw him into prison. The Confederate envoys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>were sent back to Kilkenny, charged to inform the
President and Council that the clauses concerning the
English Catholics were inadmissible and never could be
entertained by the English people who supported the
cause of Charles. Lord Mountgarret and his associates
broke off all negotiations with Ormond pending the release
of Glamorgan, which they firmly demanded. Ormond
required bail to the amount of £40,000, and the
bond was furnished by the Earls of Kildare and Clanricarde.
When Glamorgan was enlarged, he proceeded
to Kilkenny, where, to the amazement of the Confederates
and the Nuncio he defended, rather than censured,
Ormond’s course toward himself. On which McGee
grimly remarks: “To most observers it appeared that
these noblemen understood each other only too well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Frequent bickerings occurred at Kilkenny between
Mountgarret’s followers, or the Anglo-Irish, and the
Nuncio’s followers, the “Old Irish,” who were in the minority.
Rinuccini’s heart was with the latter, for, by
instinct as well as observation, he recognized that they
were the only real national party among the Irish factions.
The rest he put down, with good reason, as time-servers
and provincialists—ever ready to go back to their
gilded cages the moment the English power filled their
cups with Catholic concessions. With a little more
knowledge of Ireland and her people, the Nuncio would
have been a marvelous leader. As it was, he did the very
best he could for Ireland—according to his lights—and
he was one of the very few foreigners who, on coming
in close contact with the situation—remained true to the
Irish cause through good and evil report. He was, of
course, a devoted Catholic, but in no sense a bigot. Irishmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>should always hold his name in high honor. Any
mistakes the Nuncio committed were due to lack of familiarity
with surrounding conditions, very excusable in
an alien.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Glamorgan treaty would appear to have been
taken up at Rome, where Sir Kenelm Digby and the
pontifical ministers concluded a truce favorable to the interests
of both Irish and English Catholics. The king
needed the 10,000 Irish troops which he knew the Confederates
could place at his disposal. In March, 1646, a
modified Glamorgan treaty was finally signed by Ormond
for King Charles, and by Lord Muskerry and other Confederate
leaders for their party. “These thirty articles,”
comments McGee, “conceded, in fact, all the most essential
claims of the Irish; they secured them equal rights as
to property, the army, the universities, and the bar. They
gave them seats in both Houses and on the bench. They
authorized a special commission of Oyer and Terminer,
composed wholly of Confederates. They declared that
‘the independency of the Parliament of Ireland on that
of England’ should be decided by declaration of both
Houses, agreeably to the laws of the Kingdom of Ireland.
In short, the final form of Glamorgan’s treaty
gave the Irish Catholics, in 1646, all that was subsequently
obtained, either for the Church or the country,
in 1782, 1793, and 1829. Though some conditions were
omitted, to which the Nuncio and a majority of the
prelates attached importance, Glamorgan’s treaty was,
upon the whole, a charter upon which a free church and
a free people might well have stood, as the fundamental
law of their religious and civil liberties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>These concessions proved to be a new “delusion, mockery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>and snare.” Ormond tricked the Confederates, and
the poltroon king, just before his fatal flight to the camp
of the mercenary Scots’ army of General Lord Leven,
which promptly sold him to the English Parliament, for
the amount of its back pay, disclaimed the Glamorgan
treaty in toto—a policy entirely in keeping with his unmanly,
vacillating nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owen Roe O’Neill, notwithstanding many and grievous
vexations, chiefly arising from the absurd jealousy
of General Preston, had his army well in hand on the
borders of Leinster and Ulster, prepared to strike a blow
at the enemy wherever it might be most needed. He was
in free communication with the Nuncio, who, according
to all the historians of the period, supplied him with the
necessary means for making an aggressive movement.
The Anglo-Scotch army of General Monroe presented
the fairest mark for O’Neill’s prowess, and against that
force his movements were, accordingly, directed.</p>

    <div>The Famous Irish Victory of Benburb—Cruel Murder of the Catholic Bishop of Ross</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE forces of the belligerents were not large, according
to our more modern standards. In his comprehensive
“History of Ireland,” the Rev. Abbe McGeoghegan
credits Owen Roe with only 5,000 infantry and
500 horse, while he calls Monroe’s force 6,000 foot and
800 cavalry. The objective of both generals was the
ancient city of Armagh, and the grand-nephew of the
great Hugh O’Neill was destined to win one of Ireland’s
proudest victories in the immediate neighborhood of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>grand-uncle’s most famous battlefield—the Yellow Ford.
Marching northward from the borders of Leinster, Owen
Roe crossed the historic Blackwater and took position at
a place called Benburb, in the present county of Tyrone.
Monroe advanced to attack him, and ordered his younger
brother, George Monroe, who commanded a strong detachment,
to join forces with the main body without delay.
O’Neill, apprised by his scouts of this movement,
sent two regiments, under Colonels MacMahon and MacNenay,
to intercept young Monroe at a pass through
which he would be compelled to defile his troops in order
to form a junction with his brother. The two colonels
obeyed their orders so strictly that George Monroe’s force
was so utterly broken and routed that it was unable to
render any service to the Puritan general during the remainder
of the campaign. The victors immediately rejoined
O’Neill, who, in the interim, had detached Colonel
Ricard O’Ferrall to obstruct the elder Monroe’s march
from Kinnaird to Caledon, where he had crossed the Blackwater.
The Scotchman’s cannon proved too much for
O’Ferrall, who could only reply with musketry, but he
retired in admirable order, although closely pressed by
Monroe’s stronger vanguard. The battle of Benburb began
on the morning of June 16th, new style, 1646.
O’Neill’s post was near the river, his flanks protected by
two small hills, and his rear by a wood—all held by chosen
troops. Throughout most of the day, the Scots, who
had both sun and wind at their backs, seemed to have the
advantage, in so far as partial demonstrations could determine
the question. O’Neill, in expectation of a reinforcement
from the direction of Coleraine, “amused” the
Scotch general until the sun had shifted position and no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>longer shone full and dazzlingly in the faces of the Irish
soldiers. Almost at this propitious moment, the expected
auxiliary force reached the field, and took up position in
O’Neill’s line of battle. Rev. C. P. Meehan, historian of
the “Confederation of Kilkenny,” who quotes Monroe’s
despatch, Rinuccini’s letters, and other contemporaneous
authorities, says: “It was the decisive moment. The
Irish general, throwing himself into the midst of his men,
and, pointing out to them that retreat must be fatal to
the enemy, ordered them to charge and pursue vigorously.
A far resounding cheer rose from the Irish
ranks. ‘Myself,’ said he, ‘with the aid of Heaven,
will lead the way. Let those who fail to follow me remember
that they abandon their general.’ This address
was received with one unanimous shout by the army.
The Irish colonels threw themselves from their horses, to
cut themselves off from every chance of retreat, and
charged with incredible impetuosity.” Some musketry
was used, but the victory was decided in Ireland’s favor
by her ancient and favorite weapon, the deadly pike,
which may be called the parent of the bayonet. Monroe’s
cavalry charged boldly that bristling front of spears,
but was overthrown in an instant and all but annihilated.
Vain, then, became the fire of the vaunted cannon of the
Scotch commander and the crashing volleys of his small
arms. Vainly he himself and his chosen officers, sword
in hand, set an example of courage to their men. With
the shout of “Lamh Dearg Aboo!” which, fifty years before,
had sounded the death-knell of Bagnal, Kildare,
and De Burgh, on the banks of the same historic river,
the Irish clansmen rushed upon their foes. The struggle
was brief and bitter. Lord Blaney’s English regiment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>perished almost to the last man, fighting heroically
to the end. The Scottish cavalry was utterly broken and
fled pell-mell, leaving the infantry to their fate. Lord
Montgomery’s regiment alone retired in good order, although
with considerable loss, but Montgomery himself,
fifty other officers, and some two hundred soldiers, were
made prisoners. Monroe fled, without hat or wig, and
tradition says he lost his sword in swimming his horse
across the Blackwater. Of the Anglo-Scotch army, there
died upon the field 3,243 officers and men, and many
more perished during the vengeful pursuit of the victors,
who do not appear to have been in a forgiving mood.
O’Neill acknowledged a loss of seventy men killed and
several hundred wounded. The Scottish army lost all
of its baggage, tents, cannon, small arms, military chest,
and, besides, thirty-two stand of battle-flags. Fifteen
hundred draught horses and enough food supplies to last
the Irish army for many months also fell into the hands
of the vanquishers. Monroe’s army was, virtually, destroyed,
and he sullied a previously honorable record by
plundering and burning many villages and isolated houses
to gratify his spite against the people whose soldiers had
so grievously humiliated him.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Neill’s fine military instinct impelled him to follow
up his success by giving Monroe no rest until he had
driven him from Ulster, but, unfortunately, there came
at this crisis a request, which really meant an order, from
the Nuncio, to march the Ulster army into Leinster in
order that it might support those who were opposed in
the Council at Kilkenny to entering into further peace
negotiations with the bigoted Ormond and the now impotent
king. O’Neill could hardly decline this misdirected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>mission, but it proved to be, in the end, a fatal
act of obedience. From that hour the Irish cause began
to decline. General Preston, O’Neill’s fierce Anglo-Irish
rival, and fanatically devoted to the cause of Charles, engaged
in battle with the Parliamentary general, Michael
Jones, at Dungan Hill in Meath, and was totally routed,
with immense loss. It is only proper to remark here,
that the “Old” Irish did the best fighting during this war,
because their hearts were in the struggle, while the
Anglo-Irish, who mainly composed the armies under
Preston and Lord Taaffe—the latter of whom was ignominiously
defeated at Knockinoss, near Mallow in Cork—were
only half-hearted in their efforts. Taaffe’s defeat
was aggravated by the cruel murder of the brave
“Left-handed” MacDonnell of Antrim, who, after having
been made prisoner, was barbarously put to death by
order of the murderous renegade, “Murrough the
Burner,” who commanded the victors. This bloody-minded
wretch further signalized his cruelty by storming
the city of Cashel and sacking the grand cathedral,
founded by one of his own princely ancestors, in the
twelfth century. Hundreds of non-combatants of all ages
and both sexes, who had taken refuge in the holy place,
were ruthlessly massacred, and twenty priests were
dragged from under the high altar and wantonly butchered.
Lord Broghill emphasized his brutality in Cork
County by hanging before the walls of Macroom Castle
the saintly Bishop MacEagan of Ross, who refused to
counsel the Irish garrison to surrender. Dr. Madden, a
gifted poet, summed up the noble refusal and its tragical
consequences in the following lines:</p>

    <div>Ormond’s Treacherous Surrender of Dublin—Ireland’s Choice of Two Evils</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>ORMOND would seem to have been the evil genius
of the Irish nation at this period of its history.
He was suspected by the Confederates and distrusted by
the Parliamentarians. The former, convinced that he
meant to betray Dublin, which was poorly fortified, to
the latter, ordered O’Neill and Preston to unite their
forces and take it from Ormond. Preston, who was, to
all appearance, more of a royalist Palesman than an
Irishman, threw obstacles in the way of the intended
assault, and proposed to parley with Ormond before
assuming the aggressive. Owing to this dilatoriness,
and because of a false alarm, the combined Irish forces
retired from before the city without accomplishing anything.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>There was mutual distrust between the unwilling
allies, and, as usual, Ireland was the sufferer. Preston’s
jealousy of O’Neill amounted to a frenzy, and, before
an accommodation could be arrived at, Ormond surrendered
the city to the Parliamentary forces, under General
Jones, and fled to France, where, unaccountably,
considering his suspicious conduct, he was favorably received.
After a year’s absence, he returned to Ireland,
and, finding the royal cause desperate, concluded a peace
between the king’s supporters, the Confederates, and the
National party, headed by Owen O’Neill. This treaty was,
virtually, a revival of that submitted by Glamorgan, and
fully recognized, when all too late, the justice of the
Catholic claims to liberty of conscience. Had the original
instrument been adopted, Charles could have held Ireland
against the Parliament. But his days were now numbered,
and he died on the scaffold, in front of his own
palace of Whitehall, on January 30, 1649.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Royalist party at once recognized his heir as
Charles II. They were reinforced by many Parliamentarian
Protestants who were shocked and horrified by the
decapitation of the king; and so Old Irish and New
Irish, Confederates and Ormondists, made common cause
against the Parliament, which was defended in Dublin by
the redoubtable General Jones, and in Derry by the ferocious
younger Coote. Even the sanguinary Inchiquin again
became a Royalist and captured several towns of strength
and importance from his recent allies. Ormond massed
his army and, aided by Major-General Purcell, made an
attempt to storm Dublin. But Michael Jones made a
night sortie from the city and scattered Ormond and
Purcell and their followers to the winds of heaven. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Irish generals mutually blamed each other and there was
much bitter crimination and recrimination, but all this
could not remedy the disaster that incapacity and over-confidence
had brought about. Owen O’Neill kept his
army, which fronted Coote, near Derry, intact, but lost
his best friend when the impetuous Nuncio, who had
spared neither denunciation nor excommunication in dealing
with the trimming Anglo-Catholic leaders, disgusted
with the whole wretched business, suddenly departed for
the port of Galway and sailed in his own ship for Rome.
Had this good man had to deal with leaders like Owen
O’Neill, faithful, sensible, and unselfish, Ireland would
have been an independent nation ere he returned to the
Eternal City. His retirement placed O’Neill and the
“Old Irish” in great perplexity as regarded a military
policy. Ormond, the treacherous, was, nominally at
least, commander-in-chief of the royal army, and his
trusted lieutenants, Preston and Inchiquin, were O’Neill’s
bitter foes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Under such disadvantages, we are not surprised to
learn that O’Neill adopted a policy of his own, at once
bold and original. He temporized with the Parliamentarians,
and actually entered into a three months’ truce
with General George Monck, who had succeeded to the
unlucky Monroe’s command in the North. The distrust
and hatred of Ormond, whose military power
waned immediately after his crushing defeat by General
Jones, already mentioned, were so great that both
Galway and Limerick refused to admit his garrisons.
He and his wretched ally, Inchiquin, became utterly
discredited with the Old Irish party, and soon fled
the kingdom their infamies had cursed. Ormond returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>to England after the Restoration and was one of
Charles II’s intimates. It can hardly be wondered at,
therefore, that, to use McGee’s language, “the singular
spectacle was exhibited of Monck forwarding supplies
to O’Neill to be used against Ormond and Inchiquin,
and O’Neill coming to the rescue of Coote and raising
for him the siege of Derry.” It was unfortunate that
all of the Parliamentary generals were not possessed of
the chivalric qualities of Monck and that hard fortune
again compelled Owen Roe to draw the sword for the
cause of the ingrate Stuarts. As for the Anglo-Irish,
whether of the Church of Rome or the Church of England,
they clung to the fortunes, or rather the misfortunes,
of Charles II as faithfully and vehemently as to
those of his infatuated father. This was all the more
noteworthy, as the younger Charles had even less to
recommend him to public estimation than his sire. He
lived to be a disgrace to even the throne of England,
which has been filled too often by monarchs of degraded
and dissolute character. The second Charles of England
was destitute of every virtue, except physical courage.
He had, in a high degree, that superficial good nature
which distinguished his race, but he was a libertine, an
ingrate, and a despicable time-server. But Ireland did
not learn these truths about his character until long after
the period of his checkered career here dealt with. It
must be borne in mind, however, that in the middle of
the seventeenth century the divinity which is alleged to
hedge a king was much more apparent to the masses of
the people than it is in our own generation, when the
microscopic eye of an educated public opinion is turned
upon the throne and detects the slightest flaw, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“fierce light” which beats upon it. The Old Irish party
cared little for Charles, but when it came to a choice
between him and Cromwell, there was nothing left them
but to throw their swords into the scale for the youthful
monarch, who was not nearly as “merry” then as he
became in after days, when he quite forgot the friends
of his adversity.</p>

    <div>“The Curse of Cromwell”—Massacres of Drogheda and Wexford—Death of Sir Phelim O’Neill</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THEIR adherence to the cause of the young Stuart
brought upon the Irish nation the blighting “curse
of Cromwell,” so terribly remembered down to the present
hour in every nook of Ireland visited by his formidable
and remorseless legions. The English Parliament
well knew that a general of the first class was needed to
crush the Irish army in field and fort, and so Oliver
Cromwell, commander of the famous “Ironsides,” or
Parliamentary cuirassiers, the greatest and most relentless
soldier of that age, was sent to Ireland, commissioned
to work his will upon her. He landed in Dublin with an
army of 4,000 cavalry and 9,000 infantry, augmented by
the forces already in the island, on August 14, 1649.
Plentifully supplied with money and military stores, he
at once made ready for a vigorous campaign. His second
in command was General Ireton, a son-in-law and
pupil, who is remembered in Ireland only a degree less
bitterly than the great regicide himself. The latter
marched his formidable army, after a very brief rest,
from Dublin to Drogheda, which was held for Charles
II by a garrison of about 3,000 men, burdened with many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>helpless non-combatants, under the orders of Sir Arthur
Aston, a brave and experienced officer, who had suffered
the loss of a leg in the Continental wars. He spurned
Cromwell’s insolent summons to surrender, and successfully
repulsed two furious assaults, led by the English
general in person. A third attack, made September 10,
1649, was successful. General Aston fell, and the Puritan
soldiers quarreled over his artificial leg, which was
said to be made of gold. Examination proved it to be
of wood—a much less costly and tempting material. The
garrison, seeing their leader fall, laid down their arms,
believing that quarter would be extended. But Cromwell,
by his own admission (see his letters compiled by
Thomas Carlyle), refused this accommodation, on the
flimsy pretext that Drogheda did not, at once, surrender
on summons; and the Puritan army was let loose upon
the doomed city. For five dreadful days and nights
there ensued a carnival of rapine and slaughter. The
affrighted people fled to cellars, many sought refuge in
churches, and some climbed even to the belfries in the
vain hope of escaping the general massacre. But they
were relentlessly pursued, sabred, suffocated, or burned
to death in the places in which they hoped to obtain shelter.
The few miserable survivors—less than one hundred—were
spared, only to be shipped as slaves to the
Barbadoes. (See Cromwell’s Letters, per Carlyle.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Cromwell, in his despatch to the speaker of the English
Parliament, called this brutal achievement “an exceeding
great mercy,” and, blasphemously, gave all the praise
of the universal slaughter to the most High God! There
is absolutely no excuse for the regicide’s outrageous conduct
at Drogheda, although Froude, Carlyle, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>British historians have vainly sought to make apology
for his inhuman actions. Many of the garrison were
English and Protestant, so that race and creed did not
entirely influence him, as the same considerations undoubtedly
did at other places in Ireland. His cold-blooded
idea was to “strike terror” into Ireland at the
outset of the campaign; and in this he certainly succeeded
only too well. It made his subsequent task of
subjugation much easier than it would, otherwise, have
been. Having accomplished his work in the fated city,
and left it a smoking ruin, he counter-marched to Dublin,
rested there for some days, and then marched toward
Wexford, capturing several small towns, which offered
but feeble resistance, on his way. His lieutenants had,
meanwhile, added Dundalk, Carlingford, and Newry to
his conquests in the North. Wexford prepared for a
brave defence, but was basely betrayed by Captain James
Stafford, an officer of English ancestry, who surrendered
the outer defences, without the knowledge of his chief,
Colonel David Sennott. Quarter was refused, as at
Drogheda, and three hundred maids and matrons, many
of the latter with infants in their arms, who fled to the
market square, and took refuge, as they thought, under
the sacred shadow of the gigantic cross which stood
there, were butchered, notwithstanding their pleadings
for mercy. Nearly all of these people were Catholic in
creed, if not all of Celtic race, so that Cromwell manifested
what may be called an impartial spirit of cruelty
on both bloody occasions. His hatred for the English
Protestant royalists was as hot, to all appearance, as that
which he entertained toward the Irish Catholics, who had
embraced the Stuart cause. But his remorseless policy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>of general confiscation of the lands of the vanquished,
and the sending into banishment, as veritable slaves, of
the unhappy survivors, have left a deeper scar on the
heart of Ireland than all the blood he so cruelly, and needlessly,
shed on her soil.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tidings from Drogheda and Wexford soon spread
throughout the country, and the faint-hearted governors
of many strong towns surrendered without attempting
to make an honorable defence. Kilkenny proved an exception.
There a brave stand was made, and garrison
and inhabitants received favorable terms of surrender.
But Cromwell’s most difficult task was in front of “rare
Clonmel,” in Tipperary, which was garrisoned by a few
regiments of the aboriginal Ulster Irish—among the bravest
men that ever trod a battlefield or manned a breach—under
the command of Major-General Hugh Duff (Black)
O’Neill, nephew and pupil of the glorious Owen Roe.
This brave and skilful officer repulsed, with much carnage,
several of Cromwell’s fiercest assaults, and the siege
would, undoubtedly, have been raised only for failure of
ammunition in the Irish army. O’Neill, having satisfied
himself that this was the unfortunate fact, evacuated the
city on a dark midnight of May, 1649, and retreated to
Limerick. Cromwell, ignorant of this movement, demanded
the surrender of Clonmel next morning. Favorable
terms were requested and granted. There was no
massacre, and Cromwell’s sardonic nature made him
rather enjoy the masterly trick played upon him by young
O’Neill. Some years afterward, when the latter, after
a most noble defence of Limerick, fell into the hands of
Ireton and was condemned to death, we are informed
that Cromwell, then virtually Lord Protector, caused his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>sentence to be commuted and allowed him to return to
the Continent. Such is the effect true courage produces
on even the most brutal natures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owen Roe O’Neill, who, of all the Irish generals, was
alone fitted, both by nature and experience, to combat
the able Cromwell, died soon after that tyrant’s arrival
in Ireland, as some say by poison. He was on the march
to attack the English army, when he surrendered to death
at Clough Oughter Castle, in Cavan, bitterly mourned by
all who had dreamed of an independent Ireland. How
beautifully Thomas Davis laments him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We thought you would not die—we were sure you would not go,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And leave us in our utmost need to Cromwell’s cruel blow!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sheep without a shepherd, when the snow shuts out the sky,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh, why did you leave us, Owen, why did you die?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Soft as woman’s was your voice, O’Neill! bright was your eye,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>O! why did you leave us, Owen? why did you die?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Your troubles are all over, you’re at rest with God on high;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But we’re slaves and we’re orphans, Owen! why did you die?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Immediately after the capitulation of Clonmel, Cromwell,
summoned by Parliament to operate against the
royalists of Scotland, set sail for England, leaving behind
him Ireton and Ludlow to continue his bloody work. By
Oliver’s direction, confiscation followed confiscation, and,
when he became Protector of the English Commonwealth,
many thousands of innocent boys and girls were shipped
from Ireland to the West Indies and other colonies of
England, where most of them perished miserably. Ireton
died in Limerick, which yielded to his arms, after a
desperate resistance, in 1651. Tradition says that he
rotted from the plague, and that his last hours were horrible
to himself and to all who surrounded his repulsive
deathbed. He had caused to be killed in the city a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>bishop, many priests, and a multitude of other non-combatants;
and these atrocities appalled his craven soul at
the moment of dissolution. Ludlow, an equally ferocious
soldier, concluded the work of conquest in Ireland,
and, in 1652, the whole island was again rendered “tranquil.”
“Order reigned in Warsaw,” but it was not the
order that succeeds dissolution. Ireland, as subsequent
events proved, was not dead, but sleeping. The close of
“the great rebellion,” which had lasted eleven years, was
signalized by the ruthless executions of Bishop Heber
MacMahon—the warrior prelate who led Owen Roe’s
army after that hero’s death—and Sir Phelim O’Neill,
who was offered his life on the steps of the scaffold, if
he consented to implicate the late King Charles I in the
promotion of the Irish revolt. This, the English historians
inform us, he “stoutly refused to do,” and died,
in consequence, like a soldier and a gentleman. He had
his faults—this fierce Sir Phelim. He was by no means
a saint, or even an exemplary Christian—but he acted,
“according to his lights,” for the best interests of his
native country, and lost everything, including life, in
striving to make her free. A gifted Irish poet (T. D.
McGee) sings of him as “In Felix Felix,” thus:</p>

      <div class='line in1'>All who for Ireland ventured life or word?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>What memory would she not have cast away</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That Ireland keeps in her heart’s heart to-day?</div>

    <div>Sad Fate of the Vanquished—Cruel Executions and Wholesale Confiscations</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE subsequent fate of other chief actors in this great
political and military drama is summed up by a
learned historian thus: “Mountgarret and Bishop Rothe
died before Galway (the last Irish stronghold of this war)
fell. Bishop MacMahon, of Clogher, surrendered to Sir
Charles Coote, and was executed like a felon by one he had
saved from destruction a year before at Derry. Coote, after
the Restoration, became Earl of Mountrath, and Broghill,
Earl of Orrery. Clanricarde died unnoticed on his English
estate, under the Protectorate. Inchiquin, after many
adventures in foreign lands, turned Catholic in his old
age; and this burner of churches bequeathed an annual
alms for masses for his soul. A Roman patrician did
the honors of sepulture for Father Luke Wadding. Hugh
Duff O’Neill, the heroic defender of Clonmel and Limerick,
and the gallant though vacillating Preston, were
cordially received in France, while the consistent (English)
Republican, General Ludlow, took refuge as a
fugitive (after the Restoration) in Switzerland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The same accomplished authority (T. D. McGee) informs
us that under Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate, “A
new survey of the whole island was ordered, under the
direction of Sir William Petty, the fortunate economist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>who founded the House of Lansdowne. By him the surface
of the kingdom was estimated at ten and a half
million plantation acres, three millions of which were
deducted for waste and water. Of the remainder, above
5,000,000 acres were in Catholic hands in 1641; 300,000
acres were college lands, and 2,000,000 acres were in
possession of the Protestant settlers of the reigns of
James I and Elizabeth. Under the Cromwellian Protectorate,
5,000,000 acres were confiscated. This enormous
spoil, two-thirds of the whole island (as then computed),
went to the soldiers and adventurers who had
served against the Irish or had contributed to the military
chest since 1641—except 700,000 acres given in
‘exchange’ to the banished in Clare and Connaught, and
1,200,000 confirmed to ‘innocent Papists’ who had
taken no part in the warfare for their country’s liberty.
And,” continues our authority already quoted, “Cromwell
anticipated the union of the kingdoms by a hundred and
fifty years, when he summoned, in 1653, that assembly
over which ‘Praise-God Bare-bones’ presided. Members
for Ireland and Scotland sat on the same benches with
the Commons of England. Oliver’s first deputy in the
government of Ireland was his son-in-law, Fleetwood,
who had married the widow of Ireton, but his real representative
was his fourth son, Henry Cromwell, commander-in-chief
of the army. In 1657, the title of Lord
Deputy was transferred from Fleetwood to Henry, who
united the supreme civil and military authority in his
own person, until the eve of the Restoration, of which
he became an active partisan. We may thus embrace
the five years of the Protectorate as the period of Henry
Cromwell’s administration.” High Courts of Justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>were appointed for dealing with those who had been
actively in arms, and many cruel executions resulted.
Commissions were also appointed for the expatriation
of the people, particularly the young. “Children under
age, of both sexes, were captured by the thousands, and
sold as slaves to the tobacco planters of Virginia and
the West Indies. Secretary Thurloe informs Henry Cromwell
that ‘the Council have authorized 1,000 girls, and
as many youths, to be taken up for that purpose.’ Sir
William Petty mentions 6,000 Irish boys and girls shipped
to the West Indies. Some contemporary accounts make
the total number of children and adults, so transported,
100,000 souls. To this decimation we may add 34,000
men of fighting age, who had permission to enter the
armies of foreign powers at peace with the Commonwealth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As there was no Irish Parliament called under Cromwell’s
régime, the “government” of Ireland consisted,
during that period, of the deputy, the commander-in-chief,
and four commissioners—the Puritan leaders,
Ludlow, Corbett, Jones, and Weaver—all of whom
looked upon the Celtic-Catholic Irish, and, in fact, all
classes of the Irish people, with bigoted hatred and insolent
disdain. And these men had, until the Restoration,
absolute dominion over the lives and liberty, the
rights and properties of the nation they hated!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Act of Uniformity, which played such a terrible
part in the reigns of Elizabeth and James, was put into
relentless force. The Catholics were crushed, as it were,
into the earth, and Ireland again became a veritable
counterpart of the infernal regions. Priests, of all ranks,
were hunted like wild beasts, and many fell victims to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>their heroic devotion to their flocks. Catholic lawyers
were rigidly disbarred and Catholic school-teachers were
subjected to deadly penalties. “Three bishops and three
hundred ecclesiastics” perished violently during the Protectorate.
“Under the superintendence of the commissioners,”
says McGee, “the distribution made of the soil
among the Puritans ‘was nearly as complete as that of
Canaan by the Israelites.’ Such Irish gentlemen as had
obtained pardons were obliged to wear a distinctive mark
on their dress under pain of death. Those of inferior
rank were obliged to wear a round black spot on the
right cheek, under pain of the branding iron and the
gallows. If a Puritan lost his life in any district inhabited
by Catholics, the whole population were held subject
to military execution. For the rest, whenever ‘Tory’
(nickname for an Irish royalist) or recusant fell into
the hands of these military colonists, or the garrisons
which knitted them together, they were assailed with the
war-cry of the Jews—‘That thy feet may be dipped in
the blood of thy enemies, and that the tongues of thy
dogs may be red with the same.’ Thus, penned in (according
to the Cromwellian penal regulation) between
‘the mile line’ of the Shannon and the ‘four-mile line’
of the sea, the remnant of the Irish nation passed seven
years of a bondage unequaled in severity by anything
which can be found in the annals of Christendom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the news of Oliver Cromwell’s death, which
occurred on September 3, 1658, reached Ireland, a sigh
of intense relief was heaved by the persecuted nation.
Many a prayer of thankfulness went up to the throne of
God from outraged Irish fathers and mothers, whose
children were sweltering as slaves under tropical suns.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Cromwell himself had passed away, but the “curse of
Cromwell” remained with Ireland for many a black and
bitter day thereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>What followed after his death until the Restoration
belongs to English history. Under his son Richard, and
his associates, or advisers, the Protectorate proved a failure.
Then followed the negotiations with General
Monck, and the restoration of the monarchy under
Charles II, who landed on English soil, at Dover, May
22, 1660, proceeded to London, where he was cordially
welcomed, and renewed his interrupted reign over a
country which, at heart, despised and distrusted him and
all of his fated house.</p>

    <div>Ireland Further Scourged Under Charles II—Murder of Archbishop Plunket—Accession of James II</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE Irish Catholics had built high hopes on the restoration
of Charles, but were not very jubilant when
they learned that he had appointed as Lords Justices, in
Dublin, their ancient foes and persecutors, Coote and Broghill,
the latter now called the Earl of Orrery. In the Irish
(provincial) Parliament, the “Undertaking” element was
in the ascendant, and the Protestants, barely one-fifth of
the nation, had, in the House of Lords, 72 peers of their
faith to 21 Catholics. In the Commons the same disparity
existed, there being 198 Protestant to 64 Catholic
members. In England, the defenders of the crown, who
had fought against Cromwell, were, in most cases, treated
with justice, and many had their possessions restored to
them. In Ireland, the Royalists, of all creeds and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>classes, were treated by the king and his advisers with
shameful ingratitude. Most of the confiscations of the
Cromwell period were confirmed, but the Catholic religion
was tolerated, to a certain extent, and the lives of priests
and schoolmasters were not placed in jeopardy as much as
formerly. The Catholics made a good fight for the restoration
of their property, and were faithfully aided by
the Earl of Kildare in Ireland and by Colonel Richard
Talbot—afterward Earl of Tyrconnel—in England. But
the Cromwellian settlers maintained the advantage in
property they had gained. In 1775, they still held 4,500,000
acres against 2,250,000 acres held by the original
proprietors. The figures, according to the most reliable
authorities, were almost exactly the reverse before the
Cromwellian settlement. An attempt on the part of the
Catholics, to be allowed greater privileges than they possessed,
was met in a most unfriendly spirit in England.
One of their delegates, Sir Nicholas Plunkett, was
mobbed by the Londoners and forbidden the royal presence
by the order of the Council, while Colonel Talbot,
because of his bold championship of the Catholic cause,
was sent for a period to the Tower. The Irish Catholics
were, finally, forbidden to make any further address in
opposition to the Bill of Settlement—as the act confirming
the confiscations was called—and the perfidious
Charles signed it without compunction, although he well
knew he was beggaring his own and his father’s friends.
An English tribunal, appointed to sit in Dublin and hear
the Irish claims, declared in favor of the plundered native
proprietors, but as it was met immediately by the
intrigues of the ruthless Ormond, who again became
Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the duration of this honest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>English tribunal was limited to a certain day, when only
about 800 out of 3,000 cases had been heard. A measure
called “An Act of Explanation” was then passed
(1665), by which it was decreed that “no Papist who
had not been adjudged innocent under the former act
could be so adjudged thereafter, or entitled to claim any
lands or settlements.” “Thus,” remarks a historian,
“even the inheritance of hope, and the reversion of expectation,
were extinguished forever for the sons and
daughters of the ancient gentry of the kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An attempt made by the titled Catholic laity and the
prelates and priests of that faith to establish their true
position in regard to their spiritual and secular allegiance
was also met in a hostile manner by Ormond, who so
managed as to excite a bitter controversy in regard to a
document called “The Remonstrance,” which was supposed
to embody the Catholic idea of the period. The
viceroy succeeded to the top of his bent. Dissension prevailed
at a meeting of the surviving prelates of the Church,
and the superiors of regular orders, held in Dublin, and
Ormond made the failure of the gathering an excuse
for persecuting the prelates and priests, whom he bitterly
hated as a body he could not use, with penal severities,
which the selfish and sensual king, who was himself a
Catholic in secret, allowed to pass without interference.</p>

<p class='c009'>In this same year (1666) the importation of Irish cattle
into England was declared, by Parliamentary enactment,
“a nuisance,” for the reason that when the Londoners
were starving, at the time of the Great Fire, Ireland
contributed for their relief 15,000 fat steers. Instead
of being grateful for the generous gift, the English
lawmakers pretended to believe it a scheme to preserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>the trade in cattle between the two kingdoms. The Navigation
Act—invented by Cromwell—which put fetters
on Irish commerce, was also enforced, and these two
grievances united, for a time, the Puritans and the Old
Irish, as both suffered equally from the restrictions
placed upon industry. Ormond showed favor to the discontented
Puritans, and was recalled in consequence.
His retirement lasted nine years, and during that period
he became a patron of Irish manufactures, especially in
the county of Kilkenny. A bogus “Popish plot”—an offshoot
of that manufactured in England, during this reign,
by that arch-impostor and perjurer, Titus Oates—was
trumped up in Ireland for purposes of religious and political
terrorism. The attempt to fasten it upon the masses
of the people happily failed, but, without even the shadow
of proof, the aged and venerated archbishop of Armagh,
Oliver Plunkett, was accused of complicity in it, arrested
and confined, without form of trial, for ten months in an
Irish prison. Finally he was removed to London and
placed on trial. One of his “judges” was the notorious
Jeffreys—the English Norbury—a man destitute of a
heart. Even one of the paid perjurers, called a crown
agent, stung by remorse, offered to testify in behalf of
the unfortunate archbishop. All was in vain, however.
The judges charged the jury against the accused, violating
every legal form, and the hapless prelate was found
guilty. He was sentenced to be “hanged, drawn, and
quartered” on July 1, 1681. This sentence was carried
out in all its brutal details. When the Earl of Essex
appealed to the king to save the illustrious martyr,
Charles replied: “I can not pardon him, because I dare
not. His blood be upon your conscience. You could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>have saved him if you pleased!” And this craven king,
a few years afterward, on his deathbed, called for the
ministrations of a priest of the Church outraged by the
murder of an innocent prelate! The slaughter of Oliver
Plunkett was the most atrocious political assassination in
English history, which reeks with such crimes. The
shooting of Duc d’Enghien by Napoleon did not approach
it in cold-blooded infamy. The king, the minister, the
court, the jury—everybody—believed the archbishop innocent,
and yet he was sacrificed that his blood might
satisfy the rampant bigotry of the times.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Catholics were ferociously pursued in Ireland
after this shameful tragedy. Proclamations were issued
against them by Ormond, who had yet again become
Lord Lieutenant. They were forbidden to enter fortresses
or to hold fairs, markets, or gatherings within
the walls of corporate towns. They were also forbidden
the use of arms—an old English expedient in Ireland—and
they were commanded to kill or capture any “Tory”
or “outlaw” relative within fourteen days from the date
of proclamation, under penalty of being arrested and
banished from Ireland. This was the setting of brother
against brother with a vengeance. Few of the Irish
people were found base enough to comply with the unnatural
order, but Count Redmond O’Hanlon, one of the
few Irish chiefs of ancient family who still held out
against English penal law in Ireland, was assassinated
in a cowardly manner by one of Ormond’s ruthless tools.
The blood stains from the heart of the brave O’Hanlon
will sully forever the escutcheon of the Irish Butlers.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as the spirit of persecution of Catholics began to
subside both in England and Ireland, Charles II, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>had been much worried by the political contentions in
his English kingdom, which resulted in the banishment
of Monmouth and the execution of Lord William Russell
and Algernon Sidney, had a stroke of apoplexy,
which resulted in his death on February 6, 1685. In
his last moments he was attended by the Rev. Father
Huddlestone, who received him into the Catholic Church,
which he had betrayed so foully. He was immediately
succeeded by his Catholic brother, the Duke of York,
who ascended the throne under the title of James II.
James was a man of resolute purpose, good intentions, no
doubt, but had a narrow intellect and sadly lacked discretion—at
least in the moral sense. His physical courage
has been questioned, although the famous Marshal
Turenne certified to it, when he, in his fiery youth, served
in the French armies. He was destined, as we shall see,
to ruin his friends, exalt his enemies, and wreck the ancient
Stuart dynasty.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Well-Meant but Imprudent Policy of King James—England Invites William of Orange to Assume the Throne</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>ALTHOUGH the final outcome of his policy was disastrous
to Ireland, we feel justified in saying that
James II meant well by all his subjects. He was a
friend of religious equality—an idea hateful to the English
and a large portion of the Scottish nation at that
period. In Ireland, too, the Protestant minority resented
it, because, to their minds, it meant Catholic ascendency
and the restoration of stolen estates. But James went
about his reforms so awkwardly, and imprudently, that
he brought on himself almost immediately the all but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>unanimous ill-will of his English subjects. He dared to
profess his Catholic faith openly—an unforgivable offence
in England at that time. He sought to equalize
the holding of office by the abolition of the Test Act,
aimed against Catholics, so that English, Scotch, and
Irish Catholics should have the same rights and privileges
in that respect as their Protestant brethren. This,
also, was an idea hateful to the English mind of the
period. The king undertook to regulate the judiciary,
the privy council, the army, the civil list—every public
appointment—according to his own notions. This meant
recognition of the Catholics and produced an uproar in
England. He recalled Ormond from the viceroyalty of
Ireland and sent Lord Clarendon to take his place. Finally,
Clarendon resigned and Richard Talbot, who had
been created Duke of Tyrconnel, was made Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland. This appointment alarmed the Irish
Protestants, who, as usual, feared that the Catholics
would get back their lands under a friendly executive,
such as Tyrconnel—whose former exertions in regard to
the Catholic claims were not forgotten—was well known
to be. He was injudicious enough, at the outset, to dismiss
many Protestant officers from the Irish military
establishment and place Catholics in their positions. Although
this was done by proportion, Protestant jealousy
was aroused and the seeds of revolt were deeply planted.</p>

<p class='c009'>In England, popular feeling against the king was at
fever heat. His illegitimate Protestant nephew—putative
son of Charles II—the Duke of Monmouth, who had been
exiled, returned to England and organized a rebellion
against him. This ill-starred movement culminated at
Sedgemoor, in Somersetshire, in the summer of 1685.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>A battle was fought there between the unorganized English
peasants, under “King Monmouth,” as they called
him, and the royal army, under the Earl of Feversham.
The rebels fought with commendable courage, but were
badly commanded and suffered an overwhelming defeat.
Monmouth escaped from the field, but was captured soon
afterward, tried, found guilty, and beheaded on Tower
Hill, of bloody memory, July 15, 1685. He had appealed
in vain to James for mercy, and appealed in a manner so
craven and undignified that he aroused the disgust of his
stern uncle. But the blood of the vanquished did not
cease to flow when Monmouth died. The “Bloody Assizes,”
conducted by Jeffreys, the “great crimson toad,”
as Dickens describes him, and four assistant judges,
spread death and terror throughout the English districts
recently in revolt. This period of English history bore a
striking resemblance to the 1798 period in Ireland, when
other “great crimson toads” hanged the hapless peasantry,
and some of higher rank, by the hundred and thousand.
All this butchery made James unpopular with a
vast majority of the English people, but, as he had no
male heir, the nation hesitated to rise against him, especially
as Monmouth himself had been the aggressor. But
James, while Duke of York, had married a young wife,
the Princess Mary, sister of the Duke of Modena, who
bore him a son—afterward called by the Hanoverian faction
the Pretender—in June, 1688. This altered the whole
aspect of affairs and a revolution became imminent immediately.
Mary of Modena, although an intelligent and
amiable woman, was of a haughty and somewhat punctilious
disposition at times. This made her almost as unpopular
with the English people as was her husband. Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Walter Scott relates that, while Duchess of York, she accompanied
her husband to Scotland, whither he went at
the behest of his brother, King Charles. James got along
very well with the Scotch, particularly the Highlanders,
who adored him, and whose loyalty to his family remained
unshaken until after Culloden. He invited an old Continental
veteran, Sir Thomas Dalzell, to dine with him.
The duchess had the bad taste to object to the company
of a commoner. “Make yourself easy on that head,
madam,” remarked Sir Thomas; “I have sat at a table
where your father might have stood behind my chair!”
He alluded to a dinner given him and others by the Emperor
of Austria, who was the suzerain of the Duke of
Modena. The latter, if called upon by the emperor, would
have had to act in the capacity of an honorary waiter.
All students of history are, doubtless, familiar with the
romantic chivalry displayed by Edward the Black Prince,
when he waited upon his captive, King John of France,
whom he had vanquished at Poitiers. Mary of Modena
was, we may be sure, not formed by nature to make
friends for her husband, as the brave Margaret of Anjou
did for the physically and mentally degenerate Plantagenet,
Henry VI. Had Mary been a Margaret, William
of Orange might never have occupied the throne of “the
Three Kingdoms.” The climax of King James’s political
imprudences—they can not, in the light of modern ideas
of religious equality, be called errors—was reached when
he issued his famous declaration against test oaths and
penal laws, and decreed that it should be read from the
altars of the Protestant, as well as the Catholic, churches
throughout England. Six Protestant prelates, headed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, made protest by petition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and even visited the king in his bedchamber to dissuade
him from his purpose. But he persisted, as was usual
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the Sunday following the bishops’ call, out of
10,000 English clergymen only 200 complied with the
royal decree. Of course we, Americans, who have equal
laws for all creeds and classes, can not consistently condemn
King James for advocating what we ourselves practice,
but we can afford to lament the fatuity which led
him to dare Protestant resentment by seeking to make
Protestant pulpits the mediums of his radical policy. It
was playing with fire. Had he stopped short at this point,
James might have still held his crown, but, with incurable
obstinacy, he insisted on prosecuting the recalcitrant
bishops before the Court of King’s Bench, and they were
finally committed by the Privy Council to the Tower of
London. All England was now ablaze with fierce resentment.
At the Tower the right reverend prisoners
were treated more like royal personages than captives.
The officers and soldiers of the army—excepting the Irish
regiments raised by Tyrconnel for James, and sent to do
garrison duty in England—openly drank to their speedy
release. When they came to trial in the King’s Bench,
the jury, after being out on the case all night, found the
six prelates not guilty on the charge of censuring the
king’s government and defying the king’s mandate, and
they were immediately released amid popular acclamation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “loyal” Protestant majority had succeeded in
placing the Catholic minority, their own fellow-countrymen,
in a position of political nonentity, simply because
they worshiped God according to their belief. Who could,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>then, have imagined that the England which refused
equality in the holding of office to Catholic subjects would,
about two hundred years later, have a Catholic for Lord
Chief Justice and an Irish Catholic (Lord Russell of Killowen)
at that? Five generations have done much toward
a change of sentiment in England. But King James, we
are told, on hearing the shouts of the people when the
acquittal was announced, asked of Lord Feversham, who
happened to be with him: “What do they shout for?”
And Feversham replied, carelessly: “Oh, nothing—only
the acquittal of the bishops!” “And you call that nothing?”
cried the king. “So much the worse for them,”
meaning the people. These latter were excited by the
Protestant lords and gentry, who much feared a Catholic
succession, now that the king had an heir-male to the
throne. Both of his daughters—Mary, married to William,
Prince of Orange, the king’s nephew, and Anne,
who became the wife of the Prince of Denmark—were
Protestants, their mother having brought them up in
that belief. William, half a Stuart and half a Dutchman,
brave, resolute, and wise withal, seemed to the English
malcontents to be the “heaven-appointed” man to supplant
his own uncle and father-in-law. William was nothing
loth, and Mary, who was to share the throne with him,
made no objection to this most unfilial proceeding.
Neither did Anne, who, like the unnatural creature she
was, fled from her father’s palace, guided and guarded
by the Protestant Bishop of London, as soon as she heard
of William’s almost unobstructed march on the capital.
That personage had landed at Torbay, in Devonshire, on
November 5—the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot
of the days of James I—convoyed by an immense fleet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>which carried to the shores of England a picked veteran
army of 15,000 men. This army was commanded, under
William, by the Marshal Duke of Schomberg, Count
Solmes, General De Ginkel, and other officers of European
renown. The principal plotters who invited William to
seize the crown of England were the Earls of Danby,
Shrewsbury, Devonshire, the Bishop of London, Lord
Lumley, Admiral Russell, and Colonel Sidney. Just a
little while before the coming of William, James took the
alarm and attempted to make concessions to the Protestants.
He also decreed the strengthening of the army, and
the enlistment of Irish Catholics and Scotch Highlanders,
most of whom had retained the old faith, was encouraged.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the news of William’s arrival in Exeter, whither
he had marched from Torbay, the English aristocracy
became wildly excited and hastened to join his standard.
The faculty of the University of Oxford sent him word
that, if he needed money to carry out his enterprise,
the plate of that institution would be melted down to
furnish him with a revenue. An agreement of the nobility
and gentry was drawn up and signed, and in it they
promised to stand by William of Orange and each other,
“in defence of the laws and liberties of the three kingdoms
and the Protestant religion.” Thus, it will be noticed,
Protestant interests was the cry of the majority in
England, opposed to James, who, as we have said, aimed
at equality of all creeds before the law, while in Ireland,
where the old faith “prevailed mightily,” Catholic interests,
or civil and religious liberty, became, also, the war-cry
of the majority. In England the Catholic minority
remained mostly supine during this period and until long
afterward. In Scotland the Catholics and many Episcopalians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>rallied for James under the leadership of the implacable
and brilliant Claverhouse, afterward created Viscount
Dundee. They took the field for “James VII of
Scotland,” as they called the exiled king, at the first tap
of the war drum. The Catholic majority in Ireland naturally
recognized in the unfortunate monarch a friend who
offered them religious and political liberty, and so they
resolved to place their “lives, fortunes, and sacred honor”
at his disposal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish Catholics can not be justly blamed for their
devotion to the cause of James, who, whatever his motives,
was the first King of England who ever attempted
to do them even ordinary justice. Tyrconnel,
like Strafford in a preceding reign, although with
a very different intention, began the organization of a
formidable Irish army, which was designed to be composed
of twenty regiments of horse, fifty of foot, and artillery
in the usual proportion. There were men for the
mere asking, but arms, ammunition, and equipments were
sadly lacking. The weakest arm of the military branch
of the public service was the artillery, and this continued
to be the fact throughout all of the subsequent war. As
William drew nearer to London, the bulk of the native
English army, following the example of the highest officers—including
Colonel John Churchill, afterward the
great Duke of Marlborough—went over to him. This determined
James to abandon his capital, yet his friends
induced him to return for a period. But the still nearer
approach of “the Deliverer,” as the English called William
of Orange, again induced him to fly from London.
He had previously provided for the safety of the queen
and the infant heir to the now forfeited crown, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>taken refuge in France. The date of his final departure
from Whitehall Palace was December 11. After not a
few perilous adventures, he reached the court of his
cousin, Louis XIV, at Versailles, on Christmas Day,
1688. He was most honorably and hospitably received,
and Louis placed at his disposal the royal palace of St.
Germain, in the neighborhood of Paris. When James
heard of the desertion of his youngest daughter, Anne,
to his enemies, the wretched parent, who has been called
“the modern Lear,” exclaimed in the anguish of his soul:
“God help me! My very children have deserted me!”</p>

    <div>Irish Soldiers Ill-Treated in England—Policy of Tyrconnel—King James Chosen by the Irish Nation</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>SUCH Irish soldiers as had remained in England after
the flight of James were mobbed, insulted, and even
murdered by the unthinking multitude, so easily excited
to deeds of cruelty. These men had done the English
people no wrong—they had shed no English blood, and
they even wore the English uniform. Many fell in savage
combats with the furious mobs, but the majority
fought their way to the seaports, where they, by some
means, obtained shipment to Ireland, carrying with them
many a bitter memory of England and her people. Many
of these persecuted troops were well-trained cavalry, who
afterward manifested splendid prowess at the Boyne and
in other engagements. Their colonels were all members
of the ancient Irish nobility, Celtic or Norman, and they
were quite incapable of the crimes the credulous English
mobs were taught to believe they were ready to commit
at the earliest opportunity. Although the English people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>in their normal condition, are a steady and courageous
race, they are, when unduly excited, capable of entertaining
sentiments and performing acts discreditable
to them as a nation. A people so ready to resent any
imposition, real or fancied, on themselves, should be a
little less quick to punish others for following their example.
It is not too much to say that the English, as a
majority, have been made the victims of more religious
and political hoaxes—imposed upon them by evil-minded
knaves—than any other civilized nation. It was of the
English, rather than ourselves, the great American showman,
Barnum, should have said: “These people love to
be humbugged!”</p>

<p class='c009'>From the French court, which entirely sympathized
with him, James entered into correspondence with his
faithful subject and friend, Tyrconnel, in Ireland. The
viceroy sent him comforting intelligence, for all the Catholics
of fighting age were willing to bear arms in his defence.
James sent Tyrconnel about 10,000 good muskets,
with the requisite ammunition, to be used by the
new levies. These were obtained from the bounty of
the King of France. As Tyrconnel was convinced that
Ireland, of herself, could hardly make headway against
William of Orange, backed as he was by most of Great
Britain and half of Europe, he conceived the idea of placing
her, temporarily at least, under a French protectorate,
in the shape of an alliance defensive and offensive,
if necessary. He had the tact to keep King James in
ignorance of this agreement, because he did not wish him
to jeopardize his chance of regaining the British crown,
which a consenting to the French protectorate would
have utterly forfeited. Tyrconnel’s policy, under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>circumstances in which Ireland was placed, may have
been a wise one, although, in general, any dependency of
one country upon another is fatal to the liberty of the dependent
nation. Ireland, contrary to general belief, is
large enough to stand alone, if she had control of her
own resources. To illustrate briefly, she is within a few
thousand square miles of being as large as Portugal, and
is much more fertile; while she is almost a third greater
in area than Holland and Belgium combined. Her extensive
coast line, numerous safe harbors, and exceeding
productiveness amply compensate for the comparative
smallness of her area.</p>

<p class='c009'>In February, 1689, the national conventions of England
and Scotland, by vast majorities, declared that King
James had abdicated and offered the crown to William
and Mary, who, as might have been expected, accepted
it with thanks. Ireland had nothing to say in the matter,
except by the voices of a few malcontents who had
fled to Britain. Nevertheless, the new sovereigns finally
assumed the rather illogical title of “William and Mary,
‘by the grace of God,’ King and Queen of England, Scotland,
France, and Ireland.” In France they held not a
foot of ground; and in Ireland four-fifths of the people
acknowledged King James. James Graham, of Claverhouse
(Viscount Dundee), expressed his dissent from the
majority in the convention of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott
has immortalized the event in the stirring lyric which begins
thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To the Lords of Convention ‘twas Claverhouse spoke,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Ere the king’s crown shall fall, there are crowns to be broke,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So let each cavalier, who loves honor and me,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Come follow the bonnet of Bonnie Dundee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>James had some strong partisans in England also—mostly
among the Roman Catholic and Episcopalian
High Church elements, but they were powerless to stem
the overwhelming tide of public opinion against him.
Ireland was with him vehemently, except the small Protestant
minority, chiefly resident in Ulster, which was enthusiastic
for William and Mary. Representatives of
this active element had closed the gates of Derry in the
face of the Earl of Antrim, when he demanded the town’s
surrender, in the name of the deposed king, in December,
1688. This incident proved that the Irish Protestants,
with the usual rule-proving exceptions, meant “war to
the knife” against the Catholic Stuart dynasty. Thus
civil war, intensified by foreign intervention, became inevitable.</p>

<p class='c009'>The towns of Inniskillen, Sligo, Coleraine, and the
fort of Culmore, on the Foyle, either followed the example
of Derry, or were seized without ceremony by
the partisans of William and Mary in Ulster and Connaught.
These partisans, headed by Lord Blaney, Sir
Arthur Rawdon, and other Anglo-Irishmen, invited
William to come into the country, “for the maintenance
of the Protestant religion and the dependency of Ireland
upon England.” Thus, again, was the Protestant religion
made the pretext of provincializing Ireland, and
because of this identification of it with British supremacy
the new creed has remained undeniably unpopular with
the masses of the Irish people. The latter are very ardent
Catholics, as their long and bloody wars in defence
of their faith have amply proven, but while this
statement is undeniable, it can not be denied either that
had the so-called Reformation not been identified with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>English political supremacy, it might have made much
greater inroads among the Irish population than it has
succeeded in doing. Ireland was treated not a whit better
under the Catholic rulers of England, from 1169 to
the period of Mary I—Henry VIII was a schismatic
rather than a Protestant—than under her Protestant
rulers, until James II appeared upon the scene, and his
clemency toward the Irish was based upon religious
rather than national grounds. Even in our own day,
the English Catholics are among the strongest opponents
of Irish legislative independence, and in the category of
such opponents may be classed the late Cardinal Vaughan
and the present Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c009'>King James, at the call of the Irish majority, left his
French retreat, and sailed from Brest with a fleet provided
by King Louis, which saw him in safety to memorable
Kinsale, where he landed on March 12, old style,
1689. He was accompanied by about 1,200 veteran
troops, French and Irish, with a sprinkling of royalists,
Scotch and English, and several officers of high rank,
including Lieutenant-General De Rosen, Lieutenant-General
Maumont, Major-General De Lery, Major-General
Pusignan, Colonel Patrick Sarsfield, afterward the renowned
Earl of Lucan, and the king’s two natural sons,
the Duke of Berwick and Grand Prior Fitzjames. There
came with him also fifteen Catholic chaplains, most of
whom could speak the Gaelic tongue, and these gentlemen
were very useful to him on a mission such as he
had undertaken. The progress of the ill-fated monarch
through Ireland, from Kinsale to Dublin was, in every
sense, a royal one. The Irish masses, ever grateful to
any one who makes sacrifices, or who even appears to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>make them, in their behalf, turned out in all their
strength. A brilliant cavalcade, headed by the dashing
Duke of Tyrconnel, escorted the king from town to
town. His collateral descent from King Edward Bruce,
freely chosen by Ireland early in the fourteenth century,
was remembered. James was, therefore, really welcomed
as King of Ireland. The Irish cared nothing for
his British title. If the choice of the majority of a
nation makes regal title binding, then James II was as
truly elected King of Ireland, in 1689, as Edward Bruce
was in 1315. And we make this statement thus plainly,
because it will enable non-Irish and non-Catholic readers
to understand why Catholic Ireland fought so fiercely
and devotedly for an English ruler who had lost his
crown in the assertion of Catholic rights and privileges.
There was still another cause for this devotion of the
majority of the Irish people to King James. He had
consented to the summoning of a national Irish parliament,
in which Protestants as well as Catholics were to
be represented in due proportion, and this decision on
his part made many of the Episcopalian Irish either neutral
in the civil conflict or active on his side. The number
of such persons as were comprised in the latter class
was comparatively insignificant—just enough to mitigate
the curse of absolute sectarianism in the contest. The
Dissenting or non-conforming Irish were, almost to a
unit, hostile to the Jacobite cause.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>NOTHING could exceed the enthusiasm with which
the Irish people welcomed King James. In the
cities and towns, flowers were strewn in his path, corporation
officials turned out in their robes of state, and
speeches of welcome were delivered in English or read
in Latin. The entry into Dublin was a magnificent spectacle.
The whole city was in gala dress, and the different
trades paraded before him. Harpers played at the
triumphal arches under which he passed. Beautiful young
girls, costumed in pure white, and coroneted with wreaths,
danced the ancient Irish national dance, known as the
Rinka, in the progress of which flowers were profusely
scattered by the fair performers. The religious orders
were out in force, a great cross being borne at their
head. The viceroy, lord mayor, and members of the
corporation, on horseback or in carriages, made up an
imposing part of the procession. When he reached the
Castle, the sword of state was presented to him by the
Lord Lieutenant, and the Recorder handed him, according
to an old custom, the keys of the city. “Te Deum”
was sung in the Chapel Royal, one of the architectural
creations of the Duke of Tyrconnel. From the flagstaff
on the tower of the Castle itself, floated an Irish national
flag, with a golden harp upon its folds; and on
this broad ensign were inscribed the inspiring and sadly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>prophetic words, “Now or Never! Now and Forever!”
Wherever the king appeared in public, he was greeted
with enthusiastic shouts, in Gaelic, of “Righ Seamus!—Righ
Seamus, Go Bragh”! (“King James—King James, Forever!”)</p>

<p class='c009'>The military situation of King James’s adherents in
Ireland could not be called encouraging when he took up
his residence in Dublin. As usual, arms and ammunition
were scarce. Some 30,000 men had volunteered to
fight for Ireland, and there were not more than 20,000
stand of arms, all told, to place in their hands. And
of this small supply, fully three-fourths were antiquated
and worthless. While there were, nominally, fifty regiments
of infantry enrolled, the only serviceable regiments
of horse were those of Galmoy, Tyrconnel, and Russell.
There was one regiment of dragoons, and of cannon
only eight field-pieces had been collected. The two best-equipped
bodies of Irish troops were the command of
General Richard Hamilton, in Ulster—about 3,000 men;
and that of General Justin McCarthy, Lord Mountcashel,
in Munster—slightly more numerous. Derry and Inniskillen
held out for William of Orange, and notwithstanding
some successes of General Hamilton in the
North, there seemed no immediate prospect of reducing
them. The stubborn attitude of Inniskillen delayed the
junction of Mountcashel’s and Hamilton’s forces, which
had been ordered by the Duke of Tyrconnel, commander-in-chief
of the Irish army, with General De Rosen as
his second in command. The smaller places occupied
by the Williamite forces were abandoned as being untenable,
and the little garrisons fell back on Londonderry,
which had now become the main objective of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Jacobite army. The military governor, Lundy, was suspected
of being, at heart, a Stuart sympathizer, but he
was soon virtually superseded, first by Governor Baker
and afterward by the celebrated Rev. George Walker,
rector of the living of Donoughmore, to whom history
awards the glory of the long, desperate, brilliant, and
successful defence of Derry against the armies of King
James. It is a pity that the ability and bravery displayed
by Dr. Walker have been made causes of political
and religious irritation in the north of Ireland for
upward of two centuries. Lundy, when his authority
was defied, escaped from the city at night, in the disguise
of a laborer, and cut no further figure in Irish history.
Before his flight, King James’s flatterers in Dublin had
persuaded him to advance against Derry in person and
demand its surrender. Tyrconnel opposed the idea in
vain. He well knew that Lundy was in correspondence
with Hamilton and De Rosen for the surrender of the
city. It is quite probable that Derry would have finally
surrendered, on honorable terms, had James taken Tyrconnel’s
advice; but, with his usual fatuity, the obstinate
king took the advice of the shallow courtiers, and did
actually present himself before the walls of Derry and
demand its unconditional surrender! The reply was a
cannon shot, which killed an officer at James’s side. The
king retired with precipitation, and the citizens sent after
him the “Prentice Boys’” shout of “No surrender!” Mortified
by his rather ignominious failure, James retired to
Dublin, and summoned Parliament to meet on the lines
already indicated.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE siege of Derry was continued under the supervision
of Maumont and Hamilton, who had quite a
large force at their disposal. It is regrettable to have to
state that the Protestant population of Ulster was further
inflamed against the Stuart cause by the needless excesses
of Galmoy and the barbaric severity of De Rosen, who
placed a crowd of helpless women and children between
two fires under the ramparts of Derry, in the hope of
compelling the garrison to surrender. The brilliant victories
obtained over the Williamites at Coleraine and
Cladysford, by General Hamilton, in the earlier part of
the campaign, were more than offset by the overwhelming
defeat inflicted by General Wolseley, at Newtown
Butler, on the Jacobite army under Mountcashel. It was
Irish against Irish, but the Inniskilleners, who made up
the bulk of Wolseley’s force, were seasoned soldiers, well
armed and well directed. Mountcashel’s men were
chiefly green levies, and the battle was really lost through
their faulty manœuvring. One brigade mistook an order
to change front, so as to form a new line against a
flank attack of the enemy, for an order to retreat, and so
spread a panic that proved fatal. Mountcashel himself
was dangerously wounded and made prisoner. He lost
2,000 men in killed and wounded, and 400 fugitives, completely
surrounded, surrendered at some distance from
the field. This battle was fought on July 31, 1689, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>on the same day, Derry was relieved by an English fleet,
which succeeded in breaking the boom that had been
constructed by the Jacobite engineers across the mouth
of the harbor.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered that the gates of the city
were closed against Lord Antrim on December 7, 1688.
Hamilton’s bombardment of the place began on the
17th of April, 1689, and lasted for three months.
There was a total blockade for three weeks, and provisions
became so scarce that the defenders actually devoured
dogs, cats, rats, mice—anything, however revolting,
that might satisfy the cravings of absolute hunger.
The besiegers also suffered from bad weather and the
shots from the hostile batteries. A rough computation
places the total loss of the defenders at about 4,000 men,
and that of the assailants at 6,000—the latter loss chiefly
by disease. The relief of Derry was a mortal blow to the
cause of King James, and soon afterward he lost every
important post in Ulster, except Carrickfergus and
Charlemont. Yet, as an Irish writer has well remarked,
Ulster was bestowed by the king’s grandfather “upon
the ancestors of those who now unanimously rejected
and resisted him.” His cause also received a fatal stroke
in Scotland by the death of the brave Dundee, who fell,
vainly victorious, over the Williamite general, Mackay,
at the battle of Killecrankie, fought July 26, 1689. Duke
Schomberg arrived in Belfast Lough with a large fleet
and army on August 13th. Count Solmes was his second
in command. He laid siege to Carrickfergus, which
capitulated on fair terms after eight days’ bombardment.
Charlemont, defended by the brave and eccentric Colonel
Teague O’Regan, held out till the following May,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>when it surrendered with the honors of war. It is said
that King William, on his arrival in Ireland, knighted
O’Regan in recognition of the brilliancy of his defence.
The young Duke of Berwick made a gallant stand in the
neighborhood, but was finally compelled to yield ground
to the superior forces of Schomberg. Critics of the latter’s
strategy hold that he committed a grave military
error in failing to march on the Irish capital, which was
not in a good posture of defence, immediately after landing
in Ulster. Had he done so, King James must have
had to evacuate Dublin and fall back on the defensive
line of the Shannon, as Tyrconnel and Sarsfield did at a
later period. Then Schomberg, it is claimed, would not
have lost more than half of his army, by dysentery, at his
marshy camp near Dundalk, where King James, in the
autumn, bearded and defied him to risk battle with the
stronger and healthier Jacobite forces. There would
have been no occasion for the Battle of the Boyne, the
memory of which has divided and distracted Irishmen
for more than two centuries, had the challenge been
accepted.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Parliament summoned by James met in the Inn’s
Court, Dublin, in the summer of 1689. It was composed
of 46 peers and 228 commoners. Of the former body,
several were High Church Protestants, but, in the Lower
House, there were comparatively few members of the
“reformed religion.” This, however, was not the fault
of the king or his advisers, as they were sincere in their
desire to have a full Protestant representation in that
Parliament. But, perhaps naturally, the Protestants were
suspicious of the king’s good intentions, and so the majority
held aloof from the Parliamentary proceedings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>The most important acts passed by that Parliament were
one establishing liberty of conscience, which provided,
among other things, that Catholics should not be compelled
to pay tithes to Protestant clergymen, and <i>vice
versa</i>; another act established the judicial independence of
Ireland, by abolishing writs of error and appeal to England.
The Act of Settlement was repealed, under protest
by the Protestant peers, who did not, for obvious reasons,
wish the question of land titles obtained by fraud
and force opened up. An act of attainder, directed against
persons in arms against their sovereign in Ireland, was
added to the list of measures. Heedless of the advice
of his wisest friends, James vetoed the bill for the repeal
of the infamous Poynings’ Law, which made the Irish
Parliament dependent upon that of England; and also declined
to approve a measure establishing Inns of Court
for the education of Irish law students. In the first-mentioned
case, James acted from a belief that his own prerogative
of vetoing Irish measures in council was attacked,
but his hostility to the measure for legal education
has never been satisfactorily explained. Taken as a
whole, however, King James’s Irish Parliament was a
legislative success; and it enabled the Protestant patriot
and orator, Henry Grattan, when advocating Catholic
claims in the Irish Parliament a hundred years afterward,
to say: “Although Papists, the Irish Catholics were not
slaves. They wrung a Constitution from King James before
they accompanied him to the field.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>OUR last chapter showed that Ireland, although her
population was overwhelmingly Catholic, began her
struggle for civil liberty by a non-sectarian enactment,
which left the exercise of religion free. Yet, strange to
say, this wise and liberal policy did not win her the
sympathy of Europe, Protestant or Catholic, outside of
France, whose king had personal reasons for his friendliness.
Louis XIV was both hated and feared by the
sovereigns of continental, as well as insular, Europe.
A combination, called the League of Augsburg, was
formed against him, and of this League the Emperor of
Germany was the head and William of Orange an active
member. Spain, Savoy, and other Catholic states were
as zealous against Louis as the Protestant states of Sweden
and North Germany. Even the Pope was on the
side of the French king’s foes. In fact, when Duke
Schomberg landed, the war had resolved itself into a conflict
between the rest of Europe, except Muscovy and
Turkey and their dependencies, and France and Ireland.
It was a most unequal struggle, but most gallantly maintained,
with varying fortune, on Irish soil chiefly, for two
long and bloody years.</p>

<p class='c009'>King James made enemies among his warmest supporters
by increasing the subsidy voted him by Parliament
to twice the original amount, payable monthly. He
also debased the currency, by issuing “brass money,”
which led to the demoralization of trade, and Tyrconnel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>after James’s departure from Ireland, was compelled to
withdraw the whole fraudulent issue in order to stop the
popular clamor. Some Protestant writers, notably Dr.
Cooke Taylor, have warmly commended the king’s judicial
appointments in Ireland, with few exceptions. In
short, to sum up this portion of his career, James II acted
in Ireland the part of despot benevolently inclined, who
thought he was doing a wise thing in giving the people
a paternal form of government. But the Irish people
can not long endure one-man rule, unless convinced that
the one man is much wiser than the whole mass of the
nation, which is not often the case. It certainly was not
in the case of King James. His establishment of a bank
by proclamation and his decree of a bank restriction act
annoyed and angered the commercial classes, whose prices
for goods he also sought to regulate. But his crowning
act of unwisdom was interference with the government of
that time-honored educational institution, Trinity College,
Dublin, on which, notwithstanding its statutes, he sought
to force officers of his own choosing. He also wished to
make fellowships and scholarships open to Catholics—a
just principle, indeed, but a rash policy, considering that
every act of the kind only multiplied his enemies among
the Protestants of Ireland, who were already sufficiently
hostile. Had King James proceeded slowly in his chosen
course, he might have come down to posterity as a successful
royal reformer. Unfortunately for his fame, posterity
in general regards him as a conspicuous political as
well as military failure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among King James’s chosen intimates and advisers
during his residence in Dublin, the most distinguished
were the Duke of Tyrconnel, the Earl of Melfort, Secretary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>of State; Count D’Avaux, the French Ambassador;
Lord Mountcashel, Colonel Sarsfield, afterward so famous;
Most Rev. Dr. McGuire, Primate of Ireland, and
Chief Justice Lord Nugent. He generally attended Mass
every morning in the Chapel Royal, and, on Sundays,
assisted at solemn High Mass. One Sunday, he was attended
to the entrance of the chapel by a loyal Protestant
lord, whose father had been a Catholic, as James’s had
been a Protestant. As he was taking his leave, the
king remarked, rather dryly: “My lord, your father
would have gone farther.” “Very true, sire,” responded
the witty nobleman, “but your Majesty’s father would
not have gone so far!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Dublin of that time was not, in any sense, the
attractive city it is to-day. Beyond the great cathedrals
and the ancient Castle, there was little to attract the eye,
except the beauty of the surroundings, which are still the
admiration of all visitors. A century after the reign of
King James, Dublin, from an architectural standpoint,
became one of the most classical of European capitals;
and the Houses of Parliament, the Four Courts, the Custom
House, and other public buildings, became the pride
of the populace. These monuments of Irish genius still
exist, although shorn of their former glory; but they
serve, at least, to attest what Ireland could accomplish
under native rule. There is not a penny of English money
in any of these magnificent structures. All the credit of
their construction belongs to the Irish Parliaments of the
eighteenth century.</p>

    <div>Composition of the Hostile Armies—King William Arrives in Ireland—Narrowly Escapes Death on Eve of Battle</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>DURING the spring and early summer of 1690, the
war clouds began to mass themselves heavily in the
northeastern portion of the island, where Duke Schomberg,
his depleted army somewhat recruited, still held
his ground at Dundalk, with small garrisons posted
throughout Ulster. But it was soon known that William
of Orange, in person, was to command in chief in
this fateful campaign. Several engagements, with varying
fortune, had occurred between the rival armies in different
parts of the north country, where the Duke of Berwick
waged a vigorous campaign against the Williamites.
James, dissatisfied with the French Ambassador,
D’Avaux, and Lieutenant-General De Rosen, demanded,
and obtained, their recall by King Louis. By an arrangement
between the two monarchs, Mountcashel’s command
of 6,000 men was exchanged for 6,000 French troops,
under Lieutenant-General De Lauzun, who eventually
proved to be even a greater marplot and blunderer than
the odious De Rosen. Mountcashel’s force formed the
Old Irish Brigade, of immortal memory, in the French
service, and almost immediately after its arrival in France
was sent to operate under the famous Lieutenant-General
St. Ruth in Savoy. It also served in several campaigns
under the great Marshal Catinat, “Father Thoughtful,”
as he was fondly called by the French army. The exchange
proved a bad bargain for Ireland, as will be seen
in the course of this narration. James hoped much from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the skill and daring of the French contingent, but was
doomed to bitter disappointment. “His troops,” says
McGee, “were chiefly Celtic and Catholic. There were
four regiments commanded by O’Neills, two by O’Briens,
one each by McCarthy More, Maguire, O’More, O’Donnell,
McMahon, and Magennis, chiefly recruited among
their own clansmen. There were also the regiments of
Sarsfield, Nugent, De Courcy, Fitzgerald, Grace, and
Burke, chiefly Celts in the rank and file. On the other
hand, Schomberg led into the field the famous Blue and
White Dutch regiments; the Huguenot regiments of
Schomberg (the Younger), La Millinier, Du Cambon,
and La Caillemotte; the English regiments of Lords Devonshire,
Delamere, Lovelace, Sir John Lanier, Colonels
Langston, Villiers, and others; the Anglo-Irish regiments
of Lords Meath, Roscommon, Kingston, and Drogheda,
with the Ulstermen under Brigadier Wolseley and Colonels
Gustavus Hamilton, Mitchellburn, Lloyd, White, St.
John, and Tiffany.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The absence of a fleet, the entire navy having gone over
to William, placed James at a great disadvantage, and
explains why there were no sea fights of importance in
British and Irish waters during this war. Isolated French
squadrons could not be expected to make headway against
the united navies of Britain and Holland. William, on
the contrary, had the seas wide open to him, and, on
June 14, 1690, he landed at Carrickfergus with reinforcements
and supplies for his army in Ireland, and accompanied
by the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, Prince George
of Denmark, the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Portland,
Manchester, Oxford, and Scarborough; General Mackay,
General Douglas, and many other warriors well known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>to British and Continental fame. He established headquarters
at Belfast and caused a muster of all his forces,
which showed him to be at the head of about 40,000 men,
mostly veterans, and made up of contingents from Scandinavia,
Holland, Switzerland, Brandenburg, England,
Scotland, Ulster, together with the exiled Huguenot regiments
of France and the Anglo-Irish battalions of the
Pale. Allowing for detachments, William had under him
an army of, at least, 36,000 effective men, officered by the
best military talent of the period.</p>

<p class='c009'>James, according to all Irish and some British authorities,
commanded a force of 17,000 Irish, of whom alone
the cavalry, numbering, probably, from five to six thousand
men, were considered thoroughly trained. In addition,
he had 6,000 well-appointed French infantry, under
De Lauzun, which brought his total up to some 23,000
men, with only twelve pieces of cannon. William, on the
other hand, possessed a powerful and well-appointed artillery.
Once again, James was advised not to oppose his
comparatively weak and ill-disciplined army to an encounter
with the veteran host of William, and again the
advantages of the defensive line of the Shannon were
pointed out to him. But he would not listen to the voice
of prudence, and marched northward to meet his rival, almost
immediately after learning of his debarkation at
Carrickfergus. The Stuart army reached Dundalk about
June 22, when William was reported to be at Newry. His
scouts were soon seen on the neighboring heights, and the
Franco-Irish forces fell back on the river Boyne, and took
post on the southern bank, within a few miles of Drogheda.
The Irish camp was pitched immediately below the
hill of Donore and near the small village of Oldbridge, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the obtuse salient, pointing northwestward, formed by
the second bend in the river in its course from Slane—about
six miles from Oldbridge—to the sea. In the chart
of the battle, published by the Rev. George Story, King
William’s chaplain, in 1693, three strong batteries are
shown in front of the right of the Irish army, on the
south bank of the Boyne, and one protecting its left opposite
to the point where the Mattock rivulet falls into
the main river. But no Irish account mentions these batteries.
Some critics have thought it strange that the
Williamites, instead of making a long and tedious movement
by Slane, did not endeavor to attack both sides of
the river salient at once, and thus place the Irish army
between two fires. The water, apparently, was no deeper
above than below the rivulet, but even were it deeper, William
had with him a well-appointed bridge train, and
the feeble battery, if any existed at all, would be insufficient
to check the ardor of his chosen veterans. On the
summit of Donore Hill, which slopes backward for more
than a mile from the river, stood a little church, with a
graveyard and some huts beside it. Even in 1690, it was
an insignificant ruin, but it is noted in Anglo-Irish history
as marking the headquarters of King James during the
operations on the Boyne.</p>

<p class='c009'>The right wing of the Irish army extended itself toward
that smaller part of Drogheda which is situated on
the south bank of the river, in the County Meath. The
centre faced the fords in front of Oldbridge, where several
small shoals, or islands, as marked in Story’s map, rendered
the passage of an attacking force comparatively
easy of accomplishment. The left wing stretched in the
direction of Slane, where there was a bridge, and, nearer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>to the Irish army, a ford practicable for cavalry. James
was urged to strengthen this wing of his army, sure to be
attacked, the day before the battle, but he could only be
induced to send out some cavalry patrols to observe the
ground. When the tide, which backs the water up from
below Drogheda, is out, many points on the river in front
of the Irish position are easily fordable, and there has
been little or no change in the volume of the current during
the last two centuries. Therefore, the Boyne presented
no such formidable obstacle to a successful crossing
as some imaginative historians have sought to make
out. Neither did nature, in other respects, particularly
favor the Irish in the choice of their ground. Their army
occupied a fairly good defensive position, if its advantages
had been properly utilized. King James interfered with
the plans of his generals, as it was his habit to interfere
in every department of his government, not at all to the
advantage of the public service. An able general, such
as William or Schomberg was, might have made the Irish
ground secure; that is, with sufficient cannon to answer
the formidable park brought into action by the enemy.
The Irish army was in position on June 29, and on the
following day, King William, accompanied by his staff
and escort, appeared on the opposite heights. His main
army was concealed behind the hills in the depression now
known as King William’s Glen. With his customary
daring activity, the astute Hollander immediately proceeded
to reconnoitre the Jacobite position, of which he
obtained a good view, though some of the regiments were
screened by the irregularities of the ground. Although
within easy range of the Irish lines, he was not molested
for some time. Having concluded his observations, William,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>with his officers, dismounted. Lunch was spread
on the grass by the attendants, and the party proceeded to
regale themselves. They were allowed to finish in peace,
but when they remounted and turned toward their camp,
the report of a field-piece came from the Irish side. A
round shot ricochetted and killed a member of the escort.
A second ball caught the king upon the shoulder, tore his
coat and broke the skin beneath it. He fell forward on
his horse, but immediately recovered himself, and the
entire party rode rapidly out of range. The Irish officers,
who had observed the confusion caused by the second
shot, imagined that William had been killed. The news
was circulated in the camp, speedily traveled to Dublin,
and soon found its way to Great Britain and the Continent.
But William was not dead. After the surgeons
had dressed his wound, he insisted on again
mounting his horse, and, like Napoleon when he was
wounded in front of Ratisbon, in 1809, showed himself
to the army, whose shouts of joy speedily informed the
Irish troops that their able enemy was still in the saddle.
A brisk cannonade, which did but little damage, was then
exchanged between the two armies. It was the noisy prelude
of a much more eventful drama. On the morrow
was to be decided the fate not alone of the ancient Stuart
dynasty, but also of Ireland, with all Europe for witnesses.
Night put an end to the artillery duel, and the
hostile hosts, except the sentinels, disposed themselves
to sleep. History fails to record the watchword of King
James’s army, but Chaplain Story is authority for the
statement that the word in William’s camp was “Westminster.”
The soldiers on both sides, to use the military
phrase, “slept upon their arms.”</p>

    <div>Battle of the Boyne—Death of Marshal Schomberg—Valor of Irish Cavalry—Inexcusable Flight of King James</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>TUESDAY morning, July 1, old style, dawned beautifully
on the river Boyne. Both of the royal hosts
were drawn out in all their bravery, and the early sun
glittered on their burnished arms. We have no good
account of their uniforms, but, judging by prints of the
period, the British, in general, wore scarlet and the Continental
allies blue. Some of the French regiments allied
to the Irish army wore white and others blue coats, which
were the favorite colors of the Bourbon kings. The
Irish army must surely have worn scarlet—the livery of
the House of Stuart—because, we are informed by
George Story and other historians, they bore white
badges in their hats, to distinguish themselves from the
Williamites, who wore green boughs in theirs. The
white cockade, or rosette, was the emblem of the Dukes
of York—a title borne by James, as will be remembered,
before his accession. The irony of fate, surely, was
made manifest by the circumstance of William’s soldiers
wearing Ireland’s national color, as now generally recognized,
on the occasion of her most fateful, although
not bloodiest, defeat.</p>

<p class='c009'>At 6 o’clock <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, William took the initiative by ordering
above 10,000 horse and foot, under General Douglas,
Schomberg, Jr., and Lords Portland and Overkirk, to
march along the river bank toward Slane, cross at, or
near, that point, and so turn the left flank of the Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>army. This manœuvre was plainly seen and understood
by James and his lieutenants. Sir Neal O’Neill, at the
head of his dragoons, was detached to check the movement.
The brave leader was in time to charge the enemy’s
cavalry, which had crossed nearer to Oldbridge
than was originally designed, as they had found a practicable
ford. The main body crossed higher up, at
Slane. O’Neill, according to all accounts of the engagement
on this flank of the Jacobite army, must have made
a most gallant fight, because it was well on toward 9
o’clock before the enemy was able to secure a footing
on the Irish bank of the Boyne, and then only after the
brave O’Neill had been mortally wounded, and his surviving
soldiers discouraged by his fall. Notwithstanding,
the Irish dragoons drew off the field in excellent
order, bearing their dying general along with them.
With his latest breath, O’Neill sent word to King James
of how matters stood on his left wing, to which Douglas’s
whole imposing force had now formed itself perpendicularly,
that is, at right angles, threatening not alone
the left of the Irish line of battle, but also the rear, or
line of retreat, on the pass of Duleek, which was the
gateway to Dublin. James, observing this, became demoralized.
Instead of using the French veterans at
Oldbridge ford, where he must have seen the main attack
was to be delivered, he placed in the hedges, and other
defences which covered it, untried Irish levies, badly
weaponed, brave enough, it is true, but at absolute disadvantage
when placed in opposition to the splendid armament
and perfect discipline of William’s veterans, many
of whom had been in a score of pitched battles. Lauzun
and his French were sent toward the Irish left, accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>by Sarsfield, with a weak squadron of horse.
But Douglas had formed his troops in such strong array
that Lauzun, in spite of the direct orders of King James,
declined to attack him, or receive his attack. Instead,
he manœuvred so as to place a morass between his troops
and the enemy, and then began falling back on the pass
of Duleek, fearing to be outflanked and cut off by young
Schomberg’s powerful cavalry. Sarsfield, according to
his custom, charged the hostile horse boldly, but his men
were too few, and he was reluctantly compelled to follow
the retrograde movement of the French. In this operation
he lost one cannon, which got stuck in the mud of
a bog that intervened between the river and Donore. At
the latter point he rejoined the king. James seemed to
think only of his line of retreat. Had he thought of his
line of advance, everything might still have been rectified.
His army remained unshaken, except by his own
wretched fears. The dread of being made a prisoner
was his bane. He had sent most of the baggage and half
the cannon toward Dublin at the first news of the reverse
at Slane—a remarkable way by which to raise the spirits
of an army already sadly conscious of the incompetency
of its royal commander, and its own inferiority to the
Williamite host in everything but ardent zeal and knightly
courage.</p>

<p class='c009'>William, on learning of the success of his right wing,
immediately ordered Marshal Schomberg, at the head of
the formidable Dutch guards, two regiments of Huguenots,
two of Inniskilleners, Sir John Hammer’s regiment,
and several others on that front, including the
Danes, to ford the Boyne in hot haste. They plunged
in bravely, opposite to Oldbridge, and so dense were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>their columns, according to Chaplain Story, that the
water rose perceptibly. Still it could not have risen
much above the knees of the shortest soldier, for the
historian, Haverty—a scrupulous writer—says, in his
admirable work, that the water did not reach to the
drums of the bands that accompanied the attack. The
unseasoned Irish dragoons and infantry, armed with
old fusils and half-pikes, received the enemy with a hasty
and ill-directed fire, which did little damage. William’s
troops replied with overpowering volleys, and his batteries
threw balls into the defences. It would seem that
little was done at this point to rally the defenders, for
they soon broke and abandoned the hedges, but formed
again in the lanes of Oldbridge and the fields in its vicinity.
The shout of triumph from Schomberg’s men was
answered by a roar of anger that seemed to come from
the battle-clouds above the river. There was a sound
as of many waters, a terrific crashing of hoofs, a flashing
of sabres, dying groans—Richard Hamilton, at the head
of the superb Irish cavalry, was among the Williamite
regiments, dealing death-strokes right and left. Even
the Dutch Blues reeled before the shock—the Danes and
Huguenots were broken and driven back across the
stream. Old Duke Schomberg, in trying to restore order,
was killed near the Irish side of the river, and there, too,
fell Caillemotte, the Huguenot hero, and Bishop Walker,
the defender of Derry. It was a splendid charge, and,
had it been sustained by the whole Irish army, might
have saved the day. But King James’s eyes were not
turned toward Oldbridge ford, but to the pass of Duleek.
Fresh bodies of hostile infantry continued to cross the
stream, and were charged and driven back several times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>by the Irish horse. This part of the battle began about
10.15 o’clock and continued until nearly noon.</p>

<p class='c009'>King William now took a hand in the fight, and crossed
with most of his cavalry nearer to Drogheda. It is said
that the tide had risen so high, he was obliged to swim
his horse, which, also, got “bogged” on the Irish bank,
and was extricated with difficulty. When the animal
was freed, William remounted, and, although his shoulder
was still stiff and sore from contact with the cannon-ball
on the previous day, he drew his sword and placed himself
at the head of such of his horse as had crossed with
him. He also rallied some foot-soldiers who had been
scattered by Hamilton’s furious charges. Nor were these
yet over. Hardly had William placed his men in order,
when Hamilton came down again, with a whirlwind rush,
and Chaplain Story says, with great simplicity: “Our
horse were forced to give ground, although the king was
with them!” William, on recovering his breath, observed
the Inniskillen regiment of cavalry at a short distance,
rode up in front of them and said, in his blunt fashion:
“What will <i>you</i> do for me?” They answered with a
cheer, and rode to meet the Irish cavalry, who were again
coming on at a fierce gallop, urged by Hamilton. The
shock was terrible, but again the presence and the leadership
of the warlike William proved unavailing, and the
Inniskilleners, sadly cut up, followed the routed Williamite
ruck down the hill toward the river. Cool in the
moment of danger, William of Orange retired slowly
and managed to rally some foot and horse to his assistance.
By this time more of his cavalry had crossed,
under Ruvigny and Ginkel. The former captured some
colors, according to Story, but Ginkel’s force was routed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>and he, himself, did not conceal his vexation at their
want of firmness. He kept in their rear, in order to prevent
them from bolting at sight of the Irish horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>King James was urged by all of those about him who
had regard for his honor, including the brave General
Sheldon and the ever gallant Sarsfield, to place himself
at the head of his reserve of cavalry and charge full upon
William as he ascended toward Donore. The unfortunate
man, more of a moral than a physical coward, seemed
unable to collect his faculties; and, instead of doing what
became him, yielded to the advice of the timid, and, even
while the battle raged hotly below him, turned his horse,
and, accompanied by his disgusted officers and astonished
troopers, rode toward the pass of Duleek, held by the
French and some of the Irish, who repulsed every effort
of General Douglas to force it. Hamilton’s cavalry still
continued to charge the Williamite advance, and thus enabled
the Irish infantry to retire slowly on Donore, where
the bold Duke of Berwick rallied them and presented an
unbroken front to King William. Then, in turn, they
retired toward Duleek. Hamilton made a final furious
charge, in which his horse was killed and fell upon him.
He was also wounded in the head and made prisoner.
He was taken before William, who said: “Well, sir, is
this business over with, or will your horse show more
fight?” Hamilton responded: “Upon my honor, sir, I
think they will.” The king, who was incensed against
the general for having sided with James and Tyrconnel
against himself, looked askance at the gallant prisoner
and muttered: “Your honor! Your honor!” And this
was all that passed between them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chaplain Story, from whose book we have taken many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>of our facts, was a most graphic and interesting writer,
but a sad hater of the Irish, against whom he seems to
have borne a grudge, perhaps because they killed his
brother, an English officer, in action. He never said a
good word for them if he could avoid doing so. Yet, in
spite of this failing, the truth would escape him occasionally.
Many English writers leave the impression that
the Irish army was defeated at the Boyne within an hour
or so after the engagement began. We have seen that
the first movement was made about daylight, and that
the battle near Slane opened about 8 o’clock. In front
of Oldbridge the attack was made at 10:15, and continued
hotly until nearly noon, when King William himself took
command, crossed the river with his left wing and was
bravely checked by Hamilton. Duleek is not more than
three miles from the fords of Oldbridge. Therefore, the
Irish must have fought very obstinately when Chaplain
Story makes the following admission on page 23 of his
“Continuation of the Wars of Ireland”: “Our army then
pressed hard upon them, but meeting with a great many
difficulties in the ground, and being obliged to pursue
in order, our horse had only the opportunity of cutting
down some of their foot, and most of the rest got over
the pass at Duleek; then night coming on<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c022'><sup>[3]</sup></a> prevented us
from making so entire a victory of it as could have been
wished for.” Thus, on the testimony of this Williamite
partisan and eye-witness, the battle of the Boyne,
counting from its inception to its close, lasted about fifteen
hours. Evidently the overpowered Irish army did
not retreat very fast.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>We have already mentioned the principal men who
fell on the Williamite side. On the Jacobite side there
fell Lords Dungan and Carlingford, Sir Neal O’Neill
and some other officers of note, together with some 1,200
rank and file killed or wounded. Few prisoners were
taken. Mr. Story, as usual, underestimates William’s
loss, when he places it at “nigh four hundred.” More
candid English estimates place it at nearer a thousand,
and this was, probably, the true figure. The Chaplain,
in dwelling on the casualties, says plaintively: “The loss
of Duke Schomberg, who was killed soon after the first
of our forces passed the river near Oldbridge, was much
more considerable than all that fell that day on both
sides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Drogheda, occupied by an Irish garrison of 1,500 men,
surrendered, on summons, the day after the battle. Had
their commander made a spirited sortie on William’s
left wing, as it was crossing the river, good might have
resulted for the cause of James. It would seem that,
like himself, many of his officers lacked the daring enterprise
that can alone win the smiles of Bellona.</p>

<p class='c009'>King James, shamefully for himself, deserted the battlefield,
or, rather, the outer edge of it, before the fight
at the fords was over. An Irish Protestant poet, the late
Dr. W. R. Wilde, of Dublin, says of the incident:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But where is James? What! urged to fly,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Ere quailed his brave defenders!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Their dead in Oldbridge crowded lie,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But not a sword surrenders!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>He reached Dublin at 9 o’clock that evening, while still
the Irish army exchanged shots with William’s troops
across the Nannywater at the pass of Duleek! Tradition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>says that, meeting Lady Tyrconnel at the Castle, he exclaimed:
“Your countrymen run well, madam!” The
spirited Irishwoman at once replied: “I congratulate
your Majesty on having won the race!”</p>

<p class='c009'>English historians, in general, taking their cue from
Story, are ungenerous to the Irish in connection with the
Boyne. English troops had comparatively little hand in
obtaining the victory. The French writers, also, in order
to screen the misconduct, and possibly treason, of De
Lauzun, seek to throw all the blame for the loss of the
battle on their Irish allies. Not so, many of the Irish
Protestant writers, whose coreligionists bore a great deal
of the brunt of the fighting on William’s side, and were
thus enabled to know the truth. Among those writers
may be mentioned Colonel William Blacker, poet-laureate
of the Orange Order in Ireland, who wrote at the beginning
of the last century, and, in his poem, “The Battle of
the Boyne,” gives full credit to his Catholic fellow-countrymen
for their valor, thus:</p>

    <div>Irish Army Retires on “The Line of the Shannon”—Douglas Repulsed at Athlone—King William Begins Siege of Limerick—Sarsfield’s Exploit</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>TYRCONNEL, Sarsfield, Berwick, De Lauzun, and
their forces immediately evacuated Dublin and its
neighborhood, and, practically, gave up all of Leinster
to the enemy, while they retired on the Shannon and
heavily garrisoned Athlone, Limerick, and Galway—the
latter a most important seaport at that time. The flight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of James demoralized Tyrconnel, who was aging fast,
and further discontented Lauzun, but Sarsfield and Berwick
remained steadfast, and were determined not to give
up Ireland without a bitter and bloody struggle. Most
of the officers agreed with them. If they had lost a king,
their country still remained, and they would defend it to
the last.</p>

<p class='c009'>William’s first attempt was made against Athlone,
which is the most central fortified place in Ireland, situated
masterfully on the river Shannon, the commerce of
which it commands for many miles. The garrison was
commanded by an aged veteran of the Confederate war,
Colonel Richard Grace, to whom fear was unknown.
General Douglas, with 12,000 men and a fine battering
train, including several mortars, was detached from the
Williamite army at Dublin to attack the town. He appeared
before it on July 17, and sent an offensive message
for immediate surrender to the governor. Colonel
Grace discharged a pistol over the head of the startled
envoy, and said: “That is my answer!” The siege began
when the messenger returned. Athlone, divided by the
Shannon, is partly in Westmeath and partly in Roscommon.
The latter portion alone was defensible. Colonel
Grace abandoned the Leinster side, called “Englishtown,”
after leveling the works. He also destroyed the bridge,
thus confining himself to “Irishtown,” where still stands
the strong castle. Douglas bombarded it furiously.
Grace responded fiercely and honors were about even,
when news arrived in the English camp that Sarsfield, at
the head of a powerful Irish force, was en route from
Limerick to raise the siege. For seven days the English
general rained balls and bombshells on Athlone, but, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the seventh day, the indomitable Grace hung out a red
flag on the castle, to indicate that the fight was to be to
a finish, and that quarter would be neither taken nor
given. The English doubled their efforts to subdue the
place, but made no impression. Finally Douglas, in abject
fear of Sarsfield, raised the siege and left the town
amid the cheers of the defenders of the Connaught side.
The garrison and people gave Governor Grace an ovation,
which, indeed, no warrior, young or old, better
deserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>King William reserved for himself, as he thought, the
honor and pleasure of capturing Limerick, which, in the
days of Ireton, had won celebrity by the obstinacy of its
defence. Toward the end of July, 1690, he marched
from the capital, at the head of his main army, toward
that fortress. He was joined by the defeated Douglas,
with his depleted division, at Caherconlish, within a short
distance of Limerick, on the 8th of August. This junction
brought his force up to 38,000 men, not to speak of
a siege train and other warlike appliances. The Irish
force consisted of 10,000 infantry within the city, and
4,000 horse, encamped on the Clare side of the Shannon.
There was, as at Athlone, an Irishtown and Englishtown—the
former situated on the Limerick side of the stream,
and the latter on an island, called King’s Island, formed
by the two branches of the great river. In addition to
an infantry force, some regiments of Irish dragoons, intended
to fight either on foot or horseback, occupied Englishtown.
The defences were in a wretched condition.
Lauzun, who seems to have been the wet blanket of the
period, declared that “King Louis could take them with
roasted apples.” Tyrconnel and he were for surrendering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the city “on terms,” but Sarsfield, ably seconded by
the brave and youthful Duke of Berwick—the best of the
Stuarts—made fierce protest. De Boisseleau, a French
officer of engineers, who sympathized with the Irish people,
became their ally, and agreed to reconstruct the
works, with the aid of the soldiery and the citizens. De
Lauzun, eager to return to the delights of Paris, abandoned
the city and marched with his French contingent
to Galway. It would appear, from contemporaneous accounts,
that his troops were not all native Frenchmen.
Many were Swiss and German—a kind of Foreign Legion
in the French service. Louvois, the elder, at that
time Louis’s Minister of War, detested Lauzun—King
James’s appointee—and would not give him a corps of
choice troops. The Swiss and Germans were courageous
soldiers, but their hearts were not in the cause they
were engaged in, and many of them deserted to the
Williamites after the battle of the Boyne. Lauzun remained
in Galway until he heard of King William’s unsuccessful
attempt on Limerick, when he and his forces
sailed for France, the old Duke of Tyrconnel accompanying
them. The Duke, on reaching Paris, made charges
of insubordination and general misconduct against Lauzun,
who, thereby, lost the favor of the French monarch.
His downfall followed, and, in after years, he was one
of the unfortunates doomed to captivity in the Bastile.
He deserves no sympathy, as his whole conduct in Ireland
made him more than suspected of having been a
traitor.</p>

<p class='c009'>John C. O’Callaghan, the noted historian of the Williamite
wars, in his “Green Book,” written in refutation
of Voltaire, Lord Macaulay, and other libelers of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Irish nation, says that the Louvois, father and son, who
held in succession the portfolio of war in France, during
the time when James was struggling to regain his crown,
were inimical to his cause, and did all they could to
thwart the friendly efforts of King Louis in his behalf.
Louvois, Sr., it is explained, wished the command of the
French troops sent to Ireland conferred upon his son;
but James preferred Lauzun. Thus originated the feud
which, no doubt, led to the utter ruin of the Stuart
dynasty. The hostility of the Louvois also explains the
miserable quality of the arms, equipments, and clothing
sent by the French Government to Ireland. How fatal
a choice James made in preferring Lauzun has already appeared.
By universal consent, De Boisseleau was made
military governor of Limerick. Berwick, in the absence
of Tyrconnel, was recognized as commander-in-chief,
mainly because of his kinship with the king, while the
able and trusty Sarsfield was second in command, and,
as will be seen, did the lion’s share of the fighting.
King William, with his formidable army, arrived within
sight of Limerick and “sat down before it” on August 9,
confining his attentions mostly to the southern defences
of Irishtown, which appeared to offer the most favorable
point of assault. Although he had with him a powerful
artillery, he did not hope to reduce the city without a
further supply of heavy ordnance. Before leaving the
Irish capital, he had ordered a great siege train to be
put in readiness, so that it might reach him about the
time he would be ready to begin the investment of Limerick.
He knew, therefore, that it was near at hand.
But another soldier, even bolder than himself, knew also
of the close approach of the siege train from Dublin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>that it was escorted by a strong cavalry force. This
was Sarsfield, who, at the head of five hundred chosen
horse, left the camp on the Clare side of the river on
Sunday night, August 10, rode along the right bank
toward Killaloe, and, near that town, crossed into the
County Tipperary by a deep and dangerous ford, seldom
used and never guarded. He chose it in preference to
the bridge at Killaloe, because the utmost secrecy had
to be preserved, so that the Williamites might have no
information of his design to intercept the train. His
guide was a captain of irregular horse—called Rapparees—and
he bore the sobriquet of “Galloping O’Hogan.”
Dawn found the adventurous force in the neighborhood
of the picturesque village of Silvermines, at the
foot of the Keeper Mountain. In the deep glen, which
runs along its eastern base, Sarsfield concealed his party
all day of the 11th; but sent his scouts, under O’Hogan,
southward toward the County Limerick border, to locate
the siege train. The peasantry of the locality still point
out the exact spot where the Irish general awaited impatiently,
and anxiously, news from the scouts. The
horses were kept saddled up, ready for immediate action,
and, while they grazed, the men held their bridle-reins.
Pickets were posted behind the crests of every vantage
point, to prevent surprise, because the patrols of King
William’s army were ceaseless in their vigilance and
might come upon the bold raiders at any moment. The
scouts returned at nightfall and reported that the siege
train and its escort had gone into camp near the castle
of Ballyneety, about two miles from the village of Cullen,
in the County Limerick, and twelve miles, by English
measurement, in rear of the Williamite army. Sarsfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>immediately put his troops in motion, and, after a laborious
journey, reached the neighborhood of the rock and
ruined castle of Ballyneety some hours before daybreak.
The convoy, thinking itself secure, kept a careless look-out,
and, besides, Sarsfield, in some mysterious manner,
secured the password, which happened to be his own
name. Tradition of the neighborhood says that, as he
approached the camp, the noise of the horses’ hoofs
startled one of the English sentinels, who, immediately,
leveled his piece at the Irish leader, and demanded the
password. “Sarsfield is the word!” replied the general,
“and Sarsfield is the man!” Before the sentry could fire
off his musket, he was cloven down, and, at a fierce gallop,
the Irish horse fell upon the sleeping escort, nearly
all of whom were sabred on the spot. The captured
cannon, charged with powder to their full extent, were
placed, muzzle downward, over a mine filled with the
same explosive, and the tin boats of a pontoon train,
which was also bound for William’s camp, were piled
up near them. The Irish force, humanely taking the
English wounded with them, drew away to witness the
result of the coming explosion with greater security.
Soon all was ready; the train was ignited, and cannon
and pontoons were blown into the sky. The report was
heard and the shock felt for twenty miles around, and
startled even the phlegmatic King William in his tent.
He divined at once, with military sagacity, what had
taken place. There was no mistaking it. Already, on
the information of an Irish Williamite, named Manus
O’Brien, who had accidentally encountered Sarsfield’s
cavalcade on the Clare side, the king had sent Sir John
Lanier, with five hundred dragoons, to the rescue. Sarsfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>eluded the latter and got back to his camp, recrossing
the Shannon much higher up than Killaloe, without
the loss of a man. When the news was confirmed to
King William, by General Lanier, he said, simply, “It
was a bold movement. I did not think Sarsfield capable
of it.” Some authors affirm that Sarsfield himself said
to a wounded English officer, whom he had captured,
“If this enterprise had failed, I should have gone to
France.” He was destined to do other stout service for
Ireland before he finally shed his life-blood for the French
lilies on a Belgian battlefield.</p>

    <div>William’s Assault on Limerick Repulsed with Slaughter—Heroism of the Irish Women—Irish Humanity to the English Wounded</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WILLIAM was not discouraged by the loss of his
siege material. He found that two of the cannon
captured by Sarsfield had failed to explode. Some heavy
pieces, with mortars, also reached him, within a few
days, from Waterford, and these, with the ordnance he
had brought with him from Dublin, made a formidable
array of breach-producing engines. The siege, accordingly,
was vigorously pressed, as against the Irishtown
and King’s Island, but hardly any demonstration was
made against the Clare section, connected with Limerick
by Thomond bridge, probably because of the loss of the
pontoon train.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish soldiery and the citizens of Limerick, encouraged
by De Boisseleau, Berwick, and Sarsfield, had made
considerable improvement in the defences of Limerick
before William came up, and, even after his arrival, continued
to repair the breaches made in the walls by his
cannon. Their batteries vigorously replied to those of
the enemy, although much inferior in number and weight
of metal, and the Williamites suffered quite heavy losses
in officers and rank and file. The Irish leaders had sent
many non-combatants to the safer side of the Shannon,
but most of the women refused to leave and worked at
the earthworks like the men. Many of them were killed
by the English fire while so occupied.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last, on the morning of August 27, the Williamite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>engineers declared the breach in the neighborhood of St.
John’s Gate and the Black Battery on the south side of
the town practicable. Some authorities say it was twelve
yards wide, and others, including Thomas Davis, one of
Ireland’s most accurate writers, six perches, which would
make quite a difference. Five hundred British grenadiers,
drawn from the right flank companies of the line
regiments, as was then and for long afterward the custom,
constituted the forlorn hope. Their immediate reserves
were a battalion of the Blue Dutch Guards—the
heroes of the Boyne—and the regiments of Douglas, Stuart,
Meath, Lisburn, and Brandenburg. The whole
army stood ready to support these picked troops. The
signal, three cannon shots, was given from Cromwell’s
Fort, where William witnessed the operation, at 3.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
Story tells us the day was torrid. The orders to the
stormers were to seize the Irish counterscarp—the exterior
slope of the ditch—and maintain it. The assault was
delivered with great spirit, the grenadiers leaping out of
their trenches, advancing at a run, firing their pieces and
throwing their hand grenades among the Irish in the
works. The attack was fierce and sudden—almost in the
nature of a surprise—but the Irish met it boldly, for,
says Chaplain Story, in his thrilling narrative of the
event, “they had their guns all ready and discharged great
and small shot on us as fast as ‘twas possible. Our men
were not behind them in either, so that, in less than two
minutes, the noise was so terrible that one would have
thought the very skies ready to rent in sunder. This was
seconded with dust, smoke, and all the terrors the art of
man could invent to ruin and undo one another; and, to
make it more uneasie, the day itself was so excessive hot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>to the bystanders, and much more, sure, in all respects
to those upon action. Captain Carlile, of my Lord
Drogheda’s regiment, ran on with his grenadiers to the
counterscarp, and tho’ he received two wounds between
that and the trenches, yet he went forward and commanded
his men to throw in their grenades, but in the
leaping into the dry ditch below the counterscarp an
Irishman below shot him dead. Lieutenant Barton, however,
encouraged the men and they got upon the counterscarp,
and all the rest of the grenadiers were as ready
as they.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It would seem that, at this point of the attack,
some of the Irish soldiers began to draw off and
made for the breach, which the Williamites entered
with them. Half of the Drogheda regiment and
some others actually got into the town. The city
seemed nearly won, as the supports came up promptly to
the assistance of their comrades. But the Irish troops
rallied immediately and fell vehemently on their pursuers.
These, in their turn, retreated from the breach,
“but some were shot, some were taken, and some came
out again, but very few without being wounded.” The
Williamite chaplain thus describes the outcome, still preserving
his tone of contemptuous hatred of the brave
Irish soldiery: “The Irish then ventured (<i>sic</i>) upon the
breach again, and from the walls and every place so
pestered us upon the counterscarp, that after nigh three
hours resisting bullets, stones (broken bottles from the
very women, who boldly stood in the breach and were
nearer our men than their own), and whatever ways
could be thought on to destroy us, our ammunition being
spent, it was judged safest to return to our trenches!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>When the work was at the hottest, the Brandenburg
regiment (who behaved themselves very well) were got
upon the Black Battery, where the enemies’ powder happened
to take fire and blew up a great many of them, the
men, fagots, stones, and what not flying into the air with
a most terrible noise.... From half an hour after
three, until after seven, there was one continued fire of
both great and small shot, without any intermission; in
so much that the smoke that went from the town reached
in one continued cloud to the top of a mountain [Keeper
Hill, most likely] at least six miles off. When our men
drew off, some were brought up dead, and some without
a leg; others wanted arms, and some were blind with
powder; especially a great many of the poor Brandenburgers
looked like furies, with the misfortune of gunpowder....
The king [William] stood nigh Cromwell’s
Fort all the time, and the business being over, he
went to his camp very much concerned, as, indeed, was
the whole army; for you might have seen a mixture of
anger and sorrow in every bodie’s countenance. The
Irish had two small field-pieces planted in the King’s Island,
which flankt their own counterscarp, and in our attack
did us no small damage, as did, also, two guns more
that they had planted within the town, opposite to the
breach and charged with cartridge shot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We lost, at least, five hundred on the spot, and had
a thousand more wounded, as I understood by the surgeons
of our hospitals, who are the properest judges.
The Irish lost a great many by our cannon and other
ways, but it can not be supposed that their loss should
be equal to ours, since it is a much easier thing to defend
walls than ’tis by plain strength to force people from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>them, and one man within has the advantage of four
without.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Story acknowledges fifty-nine officers of the English
regiments engaged killed and wounded. Fifteen
died upon the ground and several afterward of their injuries.
“The Grenadiers are not here included,” continues
the English annalist, “and they had the hottest
service; nor are there any of the foreigners, who lost full
as many as the English.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have quoted this English authority, prejudiced
though he was, because the testimony of an eye-witness
is much more valuable than the allegations of writers
who give their information at second hand. We may
add, however, that all Irish historians have declared that
the Black Battery was mined for such an emergency as
destroyed the Brandenburg regiment, and some of them
assert that Sarsfield, in person, fired the mine. As he
was the Ajax of the campaign, on the Irish side, it
seems quite natural that every extraordinary feat of skill
or valor should have been credited to him. His own
merits made him the idol of his people, and he was
farther endeared to them, as being the son of Anna
O’More, daughter of the famous organizer of the Irish
insurrection of 1641. On the paternal side, he was of
Norman stock. His father had been a member of the
Irish House of Commons, and was proscribed and exiled
because he had sided with the patriots in the Parliamentary
wars. General Sarsfield—the rank he held at
the first siege of Limerick—had seen hot service on the
Continent, during the early part of his career, and commanded
a regiment of the royal cavalry at the battle of
Sedgemoor, where the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>met with his fatal defeat at the hands of Lord Feversham.
In stature, he was tall—considerably over six
feet—fair and strikingly handsome. His flowing wig—in
the queer fashion of the period—fell in massive ringlets
over the corselet of a cuirassier, and, in the rush of
battle, he must have been the counterpart of Murat, Napoleon’s
“Emperor of Dragoons.” Irish poets have called
him “headlong Sarsfield.” “Long-headed Sarsfield” would
have been a better sobriquet, for, had his advice been
taken by his royal master and the generals sent by the
latter to command over him, Ireland would never have
bowed her head to the yoke of William. Even the most
envenomed of English historians against the adherents
of King James—including Lord Macaulay—do ample
justice to the courage, talents, and virtues of Patrick
Sarsfield.</p>

<p class='c009'>The heroic women of Limerick, who fought and bled
in the breach, are complimented by Chaplain Story, as
we have seen, at the expense of their countrymen, but
the glorious military record of the Irish race in the wars
of Europe and of this continent, since that period, would
make any defence of the conduct of the heroes of Limerick-breach
superfluous. The women, too, deserve immortal
honor; because, in defence of their country and
hearthstones, they dared the storm of war, and “stalked
with Minerva’s step where Mars might quake to tread.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish loss in killed and wounded was about four
hundred. Many lives, on both sides, were lost by sickness—dysentery
and enteric fever chiefly—during this
siege. A conservative estimate places William’s loss,
by wounds and sickness, at 5,000, and the Irish at 3,000.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day after his bloody repulse, King William sent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>flag of truce to De Boisseleau asking the privilege of
burying his dead. After consultation with Berwick and
Sarsfield, the French governor refused the request, as he
suspected a ruse of some kind behind it. All the dead
were buried by the Irish as quickly as possible, because
the heat was intense, and, aside from feelings of humanity,
they dreaded a plague from the decomposition of the
corpses left above ground. We are informed by the late
Mr. A. M. Sullivan, M.P., in his admirable “Story of
Ireland,” that, during the pursuit by the Irish of King
William’s men from the breach to their trenches, the
temporary hospital established by the king for his
wounded caught fire. The Irish troops immediately
paused in their fierce pursuit, and devoted themselves to
saving their helpless foes in the hospital, who, otherwise,
must have perished miserably in the flames.</p>

<p class='c009'>King William, after carefully considering the situation,
and taking counsel with his chief officers, decided
that there was no hope of capturing Limerick that year.
Therefore, he declared the siege raised—that is, abandoned—and,
on August 30th, the entire Williamite army
drew off from before Limerick, posting strong rear-guards
at points of vantage, so as to baffle pursuit. The
king, leaving Baron De Ginkel in command, retired to
Waterford. There he embarked for England, bidding
Ireland what proved to be an eternal farewell. Although
this gloomy monarch was not quite as ferocious as some
of his contemporaries, and was a marked improvement
on Cromwell, Ireton, and Ludlow in Ireland, he is
charged by careful Irish historians—like McGee, O’Callaghan,
and Sullivan—with having, like his lieutenant,
General Douglas, permitted many outrages on the people,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>both in person and property, on his march from
Dublin to Limerick. Making due allowance for the difficulty
of restraining a mercenary army, filled with hatred
of the people they moved among, from committing excesses,
it is regrettable that the martial renown of William
of Orange is sullied by this charge of cruelty in Ireland,
as, afterward, in connection with the foul massacre of
the Macdonalds of Glencoe in Scotland. Brave men are
rarely cruel, but we fear, in these instances, William was
an exception to the rule.</p>

<p class='c009'>The story of the first defence of Limerick, in the Williamite
war, reads like a chapter from a military romance,
and yet it was, indeed, a stern and bloody reality. It
was, in truth, a magnificent defence against a powerful
foe, not surpassed even by that of Saragossa against the
French. Limerick, like Saragossa, was defended by the
citizens, men and women, quite as much as by the soldiery.
All took equal risks, as in the case of Londonderry.
The latter was also a brilliant defence—more,
however, in the matter of splendid endurance than in
hand-to-hand conflict. Londonderry wears the crown
for fortitude and tenacity—Limerick and Saragossa for
heroic prowess and matchless courage.</p>

    <div>Fall of Cork and Kinsale—Lauzun, the French General, Accused by Irish Writers—Sarsfield’s Popularity—Tyrconnel Returns to Ireland—Berwick Departs</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE successful defence of Limerick by the Irish was
somewhat offset in the following month of September
by the victorious expedition from England, against
Cork and Kinsale, led by John Churchill, afterward
Duke of Marlborough, the greatest general of that age.
Cork, under the military governor, McEligott, defended
itself vigorously during a siege of five days, but the defences
and garrison were both weak, and, eventually, the
city capitulated on honorable conditions. These were
subsequently violated by some soldiers and camp-followers
of the English army, but Marlborough suppressed, in
as far as he could, the disorders as soon as he heard of
them. The English lost the Duke of Grafton—natural
son of Charles II—and many other officers and private
men during the siege. Marlborough, with characteristic
promptitude, moved at once on Kinsale. The old town
and fort, not being defensible, were, after some show of
resistance, abandoned by the Irish troops, who took post
in the new fort, commanding the harbor, which they held
with creditable tenacity, during fourteen days. They,
at last, capitulated, their ammunition having run low,
and were allowed, in recognition of their valor, to retire
to Limerick, the garrison in that city being thus augmented
by 1,200 tried warriors. Marlborough accomplished
his task within five weeks, and returned to England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>a popular idol. The loss of Cork and Kinsale, particularly
the latter, was a severe blow to the Irish army,
as it was, thereby, deprived of the most favorable seaports
by which supplies from France could reach it. It
should have been stated that Marlborough, in the capture
of those towns, was materially assisted by the English
fleet. His army was a very formidable one, consisting
of 9,000 picked men from England, and a detachment,
nearly equal in numbers, which joined him, under the
Duke of Wurtemburg and General Scravenmore. The
latter body consisted of troops who had fought at the
Boyne and Limerick. Wurtemburg, on account of his
connection with royalty, claimed the command in chief.
Marlborough, who was as great a diplomat as he was a
general, agreed to command alternately, but he was, all
through the operations, the real commander. Students
of history will remember that, in after wars on the Continent,
Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy commanded
on alternate days. But there was a great difference
in this case, Eugene having been regarded as nearly
as good a general as Marlborough himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Callaghan attributes the failure of the main Irish
army to succor the Cork and Kinsale garrisons to the misconduct
of Lauzun in deserting Ireland, with his remaining
5,000 French troops, at this critical period. He
quotes King James’s and Berwick’s memoirs, the Rawdon
papers, and other authorities, to show that the Duke
of Berwick had advanced with 7,000 men as far as Kilmallock,
in Limerick County, to raise the siege of Cork,
when he found himself destitute of cannon, which had
been carried off by the French general, and could not expose
his inferior force, destitute of artillery, to the formidable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>force under his uncle, Marlborough. He was,
therefore, most reluctantly compelled to abandon the enterprise.
Lauzun, it is further claimed, carried off most
of the powder stored in Limerick, and, had it not been for
Sarsfield’s exploit at Ballyneety, that city must have fallen
if a second assault had been delivered by William, as only
fifty barrels of powder remained after the fight of August
27th.</p>

<p class='c009'>The autumn and winter of 1690-91 were marked by
constant bloody skirmishes between the cavalry and infantry
outposts of the two armies. Hardly a day passed
without bloodshed. Considerable ferocity was exhibited
by both parties, and neither seemed to have much the
advantage of the other. Story’s narrative of this period
is one unbroken tale of disorder and strife. His narration,
if taken without a grain of salt, would lead us to
believe that nearly all the able-bodied Celtic-Irish were
put to the sword, at sight, by his formidable countrymen
and their allies, although he does admit, occasionally,
that the Irish succeeded in killing a few, at least,
of their enemies. The most considerable of these lesser
engagements occurred between Sarsfield and the Duke
of Berwick on the Irish side and General Douglas and
Sir John Lanier on the side of the Williamites. The
Irish leaders made an attack on Birr Castle in September,
and were engaged in battering it, when the English,
under Lanier, Douglas, and Kirk, marched to relieve it.
They were too many for Berwick and Sarsfield, who
retired on Banagher, where there is a bridge over the
Shannon. The English pursued and made a resolute attempt
to take the bridge, but the Irish defended it so
steadily, and with such loss to the enemy, that the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>abandoned the attempt at capture and retired to Birr.
Sarsfield possessed one great advantage over all the
higher officers of King James’s army. He could speak
the Irish (Gaelic) language fluently, having learned it
from the lips of his mother, Anna O’More. This gave
him vast control over the Celtic peasantry, who fully
trusted him, as he did them, and they kept him informed
of all that was passing in their several localities. The
winter was exceptionally severe—so much so that, at
some points, the deep and rapid Shannon was all but
frozen across. Besides, there were several bridges that,
if carelessly guarded, could be easily surprised and taken
by the invaders. Sarsfield’s Celtic scouts, in December,
observed several parties of British cavalry moving along
the banks of the river. Their suspicions were excited,
and they, at once, communicated with their general.
The latter had no sooner taken the alarm than one English
force, under Douglas, showed itself at Jamestown,
and another, under Kirk and Lanier, at Jonesboro. The
English commanders were astonished at finding the Irish
army prepared to receive them warmly at both points.
After severe skirmishing, they withdrew. The cold had
become so severe that foreign troops were almost useless,
while the Irish became, if possible, more alert. Sarsfield,
at the head of his formidable cavalry, harassed the retreat
of the Williamites to their winter quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke of Tyrconnel, who had, according to O’Callaghan,
and other annalists, sailed from Galway with
Lauzun, and, according to other authorities from Limerick,
with De Boisseleau, after William’s repulse, returned
from France, in February, accompanied by three
men-of-war well laden with provisions. They carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>but few arms and no reinforcements, but the aged duke,
who seemed to be in good spirits, said that the latter
would speedily follow. The amount of money he brought
with him was comparatively insignificant—only 14,000
louis d’or—which he devoted to clothing for the army,
as most of the men were nearly in rags, and had received
no pay in many months. He had deposited 10,000 louis,
additional, at Brest for the food supply of the troops.</p>

<p class='c009'>He found unholy discord raging in the Irish ranks.
Sarsfield had discovered that some members of the Senate,
or Council, appointed by Tyrconnel before he left
for France, had been in treasonable correspondence with
the enemy, and that this treachery had led to the attempt
at the passage of the Shannon made by the English in
December. The Council consisted of sixteen members,
four from each province, and was supposed to have
supreme direction of affairs. Through the influence of
Sarsfield, Lord Riverston and his brother, both of whom
were strongly suspected of treason, were dismissed from
that body, and Judge Daly, another member, whose honesty
was doubted, was placed under arrest in the city of
Galway. A difference had also arisen between Sarsfield
and Berwick, although they were generally on good
terms, because the former did not always treat the latter
with the deference due an officer higher in rank. Berwick
was an admirable soldier, but he lacked Sarsfield’s
experience, and, naturally, did not understand the Irish
people quite as well as the native leader did. In fact,
Sarsfield was the hero of the time in the eyes of his
countrymen, and, had he been unduly ambitious, might
have deposed Berwick, or even Tyrconnel, and made
himself dictator. But he was too good a patriot and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>true a soldier to even harbor such a thought. After all
his splendid services, he was ungratefully treated. He
deserved the chief command, but it was never given him,
and he received, instead, the barren title of Earl of Lucan,
the patent of which had been brought over from James
by Tyrconnel. But it was gall and wormwood for Sarsfield
to learn from the duke that a French commander-in-chief,
Lieutenant-General the Marquis de St. Ruth, had
been chosen by Louis and James to take charge of military
matters in Ireland forthwith. Already he ranked
below Tyrconnel and Berwick, although having much
more ability than the two combined, as he had proven on
many occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>General St. Ruth, if we are to believe Lord Macaulay
and other Williamite partisans, was more distinguished
for fierce persecution of the French Protestants, called
Huguenots, than anything else in his career. He had
served in the French army, in all its campaigns, under
Turenne, Catinat, and other celebrated soldiers, since
1667, and, while yet in vigorous middle life, had won
the rank of lieutenant-general. He had married the
widow of old Marshal De Meilleraye, whose page he had
been in his boyhood, and, according to St. Simon’s gossipy
memoirs, the couple led a sort of cat-and-dog existence,
the king having been often compelled to interfere
between them. Of St. Ruth’s person, St. Simon
says: “He was tall and well-formed, but, as everybody
knew, extremely ugly.” The same authority says the
general was “of a brutal temper,” and used to baton his
wife whenever she annoyed him. It is well known that
St. Simon was a venomous detractor of those who had
incurred his resentment, or that of his friends, and this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>may account for his uncomplimentary references to St.
Ruth. Irish tradition says that the latter was hard-featured,
but of commanding person, with a piercing glance
and a voice like a trumpet. It is certain that he had an
imperious disposition and was quick to fly into a rage.
When appointed to the command in Ireland, he had just
returned from a successful campaign in Savoy, where
Mountcashel’s Irish Brigade, as already stated, had
formed a portion of his victorious forces. He had learned
to appreciate Irish courage and constancy during that
campaign, and was, on that account as much as any other,
deemed the fit man to lead the Irish soldiers on their own
soil to victory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tyrconnel had accepted St. Ruth from Louis and
James, because he could not help himself, and, also, because
he was jealous of Sarsfield. The viceroy was no
longer popular in Ireland. He was aged, infirm, and
incompetent, and it would seem his temper had grown so
bad that he could not get along peaceably with anybody.
One faction from the Irish camp had sent representatives
to James in the palace of St. Germain, begging that
Tyrconnel be recalled and the command placed in the
hands of Sarsfield. But Tyrconnel, because of old association,
was all-powerful with the exiled king, and his
cause, therefore, prevailed. Soon afterward the gallant
Duke of Berwick, who subsequently won the battle of
Almanza and placed Philip V—King Louis’s grandson—on
the throne of Spain, unable to agree with either
Tyrconnel or Sarsfield, was relieved of command in Ireland
and joined his father in France. This was an additional
misfortune for Ireland. Berwick, the nephew of
the great Duke of Marlborough, was, both by nature and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>training, a thorough soldier. He was the very soul of
bravery, and could put enthusiasm into an Irish army by
his dashing feats of arms. He was missed in the subsequent
battles and sieges of that war. His career in the
French army was long and brilliant. After rising to the
rank of marshal, he was killed by a cannon shot while
superintending the siege of Philipsburg, in 1734. The
aristocratic French family of Fitzjames is lineally descended
from the Duke of Berwick, and that house, although
of illegitimate origin, represents the male Stuart
line, just as the House of Beaufort, in England, represents,
with the bend sinister shadowing its escutcheon,
the male line of the Plantagenets. Strange to say, the
Duke of Berwick’s great qualities as a general were not
even suspected by his associates, either French, English,
or Irish, in Ireland. When Tyrconnel left him in command,
leading officers of the Irish army declared that they
would not serve, unless he consented to be governed by
a council more national in composition than that nominated
by Tyrconnel. After some strong protests, Berwick
yielded the point, but never afterward made any
attempt at bona-fide command. He felt that he was but
a figurehead, and was glad when Tyrconnel’s return led
to his recall from a position at once irksome and humiliating.
Had he been King James’s legitimate son, the
House of Stuart would probably have found in him a
restorer. He inherited the Churchill genius from his
mother, Arabella, who was King James’s mistress when
that monarch was Duke of York. She was not handsome
of feature, but her figure was perfect, and the deposed
king, to judge by his selections, must have had a penchant
for plain women. O’Callaghan, in his “History of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Irish Brigades,” says of the Duke of Berwick: “He was
one of those commanders of whom it is the highest eulogium
to say that to such, in periods of adversity, it is
safest to intrust the defence of a state. Of the great
military leaders of whose parentage England can boast,
he may be ranked with his uncle, Marlborough, among
the first. But to his uncle, as to most public characters,
be was very superior as a man of principle. The Regent
Duke of Orleans, whose extensive acquaintance with human
nature attaches a suitable value to his opinion, observed:
‘If there ever was a perfectly honest man in the
world, that man was the Marshal Duke of Berwick.’”
We have also the testimony of his French and other contemporaries
that he was a man of majestic appearance—much
more “royal” in that respect than any other scion of
his race.</p>

    <div>General St. Ruth Arrives at Limerick to Command the Irish Army—His Marvelous Activity—Brave and Able, but Vain and Obstinate</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE garrison of Limerick was beginning to despair
of any farther succor from France, and murmurs
against the viceroy became loud and deep, when runners
arrived from the southwestern coast, announcing that a
French fleet had been sighted off the Kerry coast, and
that it was, probably, steering for the estuary of the
Shannon. This was in the first week of May, and, on
the 8th of that month, the French men-of-war cast anchor
in the harbor of Limerick. On board was Lieutenant-General
St. Ruth, with Major-General D’Usson, Major-General
De Tesse, and other officers. He brought with
him, in the ships, provisions, a supply of indifferent clothing,
and a quantity of ammunition, but no reinforcements
of any kind. The general, however, had a large
personal staff and a retinue of servants and orderlies.
He was received, on landing, by Tyrconnel, Sarsfield,
Sheldon, and other army leaders. He and his officers
attended pontifical High Mass at St. Mary’s Cathedral,
where Te Deum was chanted. Macaulay, a somewhat
imaginative authority, informs us that St. Ruth was
disappointed, if not disgusted, by the conditions then
existing in Limerick. He had been accustomed to command
troops perfectly uniformed and equipped. The
Irish army was poorly dressed and indifferently armed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>He had seen the splendid legions of Mountcashel in
Savoy, dressed scrupulously and bearing the best arms
of that day, and he was quite unprepared to behold the
undeniable poverty of the brave defenders of Athlone
and Limerick. But he was a practical soldier, and at
once set about what an American general would call
“licking his army into shape.” Dissatisfied with the cavalry
mounts, he resorted to a ruse to supply the deficiency.
The “gentry” of the surrounding districts were
summoned to King’s Island to deliberate on the question
of national defence. They came in large numbers—every
man, as was the custom of the times, mounted on
a strong and spirited horse. When all had assembled,
St. Ruth, through an interpreter, addressed them in spirited
words. One of the chief needs of the hour was
cavalry horses. The gentlemen were invited to dismount
and turn over their horses to the public service. This
most of them did cheerfully, while others were chagrined.
However, St. Ruth gained his point, and the Irish troopers
were as well mounted as any in the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The new French general, although much given to
pleasure, was a man of extraordinary energy. He gave
balls to honor the country gentlemen and their families,
and the French uniform became very familiar in all the
aristocratic Catholic circles of Munster and Connaught.
St. Ruth participated in the dancing and feasting, but
was always “up betimes,” and away on horseback, attended
by his staff and interpreters, to inspect the posts
held by the Irish along the Shannon and Suck. It was
during one of those rides, tradition says, he noticed the
hill of Kilcommodan, rising above the little hamlet of
Aughrim, near Ballinasloe, and, casting a glance at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>position, exclaimed to his officers, in French, “That is
the choicest battleground in all Europe!” We shall hear
more about Aughrim, and what there befell Monsieur
St. Ruth and the Irish army.</p>

<p class='c009'>That brave army, at Limerick, Athlone, and Galway,
was put through a course of drilling, such as it had never
received before, under the orders of the ardent and indefatigable
Frenchman. He repressed disorder with an
iron hand, and made such examples, under martial law,
as seemed necessary. It is said he was severe to his
officers and contemptuous to the rank and file of his
army, but these assertions come mainly from Chaplain
Story and chroniclers of his class. The haughty Irish
aristocrats would have run St. Ruth through the body
with their swords if he had dared to be insulting toward
them. He was necessarily strict, no doubt, and this
strictness bore glorious fruit when the reorganized army
again took the field. One of the chief embarrassments
of the time was lack of money. Lauzun, while in Ireland,
had played into the hands of the English by crying
down King James’s “brass money,” as it was called, issued
on the national security. The poor devoted Irish soldiers
took it readily enough, but the trading and commercial
classes, always sensitive and conservative where
their interests are affected, were slow to take the tokens
in exchange for their goods. King Louis had promised
a large supply of “good money,” but, somehow, it was
not forthcoming, except in small parcels, which did little
good. We may be sure, however, that St. Ruth, accustomed
to Continental forced loans, did not stand on
ceremony, and, under his vigorous régime, the Irish army
was better armed, better fed, and better clad than it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>been since the outbreak of the war. Old Tyrconnel ruled
Ireland nominally. The real ruler, after he had, by repeated
representations and solicitations, obtained unrestricted
military command, was St. Ruth himself. Unhappily
for Ireland, he slighted Tyrconnel, who was a
very proud man, and did not get along smoothly with
Sarsfield, whose sage advice, had he taken it, would have
saved him from a fatal disaster.</p>

<p class='c009'>Baron De Ginkel, commander-in-chief for William,
marched with an army computed at 19,000 men from Dublin
to open the campaign against the Irish on the line of
the Shannon, on May 30, 1691. On June 7, he reached the
fort of Ballymore, held by a small Irish force under Lieutenant-Colonel
Ulick Burke, and summoned it to surrender.
Burke answered defiantly, and Ginkel immediately
opened upon his works. A detached post, held by a sergeant
and a few men, was defended desperately and caused
the Williamites serious loss. It was finally captured, and
De Ginkel, with inexcusable cruelty, hanged the brave
sergeant, for doing his duty, as O’Callaghan says, on the
shallow pretext that he had defended an untenable position.
Colonel Burke, nothing daunted, continued his
defence of Ballymore, although Ginkel threatened him
with the unfortunate sergeant’s fate. The fire of eighteen
well-served pieces of heavy artillery speedily reduced the
fort to a ruin. The Irish engineer officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Burton, was killed, and many men had also fallen.
Burke hung out a flag of truce and demanded the honors
of war if he were to surrender the place. Ginkel refused
and called for immediate submission. The utmost time
he would grant was two hours, and he agreed to allow
the women and children to depart within that period.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Once he proceeded to storm the position, he said, the garrison
need expect no quarter. Colonel Burke declined to
be intimidated and the work of destruction began anew—the
women and children still remaining in the beleaguered
fort. The latter was situated near the town of
the same name, in the County Westmeath, on a peninsula
which jutted into a small loch, or lake, and was too far
from support to make a successful defence. It stood
about midway between Mullingar and Athlone on the road
from Dublin. Finally, Ginkel managed to assail it on the
water front, breaches were made, and further resistance
was useless. Therefore, Governor Burke finally surrendered.
He and his command were made prisoners of
war, and, in the sinister words of Story, the four hundred
women and children, destitute of food, shelter, and
protection, were “set at liberty.” What subsequently became
of them is not stated. Colonel Burke was exchanged
and fell in battle, at Aughrim, soon afterward.
Seven days were occupied by De Ginkel in again putting
Ballymore into a state of defence. He then resumed his
march on Athlone, and, on June 18, was joined at Ballyburn
Pass by the Duke of Wurtemburg and Count Nassau,
at the head of 7,000 foreign mercenaries, and these,
according to O’Callaghan, the most painstaking of historical
statisticians, brought his force up to “between
26,000 and 27,000 men of all arms.”</p>

    <div>De Ginkel Besieges Athlone—Memorable Resistance of the Irish Garrison—The Battle at the Bridge—St. Ruth’s Fatuous Obstinacy—Town Taken by Surprise</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>ST. RUTH had been advised by the Irish officers of
his staff not to attempt the defence of the “Englishtown”
of Athlone, on the Leinster bank of the Shannon;
but, rather, to confine himself to the defence of the Connaught
side, as Governor Grace had done so successfully
in the preceding year. He paid no attention to their
counsel, considering, after reflection, that the Williamite
army should be met and beaten back from the Englishtown,
and believing that the bridge, which, in the event
of abandonment, must be destroyed, might prove useful
in future military operations. Accordingly, Colonel
John Fitzgerald was appointed governor of this portion
of Athlone, and, with a very insufficient force, prepared
to do his duty. Ginkel, his well-fed ranks, according
to Macaulay, “one blaze of scarlet,” and provided with
the finest artillery train ever seen in Ireland, appeared
before Athlone on the morning of June 19th. His advance
was most gallantly disputed and retarded by a detachment
of Irish grenadiers, selected by Governor Fitzgerald,
for that important duty. He took command of
them in person, and they fought so bravely and obstinately,
that the enemy were delayed in their progress for
several hours, so that the Irish garrison was well prepared
to receive them, when they finally appeared within
gunshot of the walls. The attack on Englishtown began
immediately, Ginkel planting such of his cannon as had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>already come up with great judgment; and Fitzgerald
replied to his fire with the few and inefficient pieces he
possessed. But his Irish soldiers performed prodigies of
heroism. Their deeds of unsurpassed valor are thus
summed up by Mr. O’Callaghan in an epitaph which he
suggested, in his “Green Book,” should be engraved on a
memorial stone in the locality of the action to be revered
by the Irish people of all creeds and parties:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be it remembered that, on the 19th and 20th of June,
1691, a little band, of between three hundred and four
hundred Irishmen, under Colonel Fitzgerald, contested
against an English army of about 26,000 men, under
Lieutenant-General Ginkel, the passes leading to, and the
English town of, Athlone. And though the place had
but a slender wall, in which the enemy’s well-appointed
and superior artillery soon made a large breach, and
though its few defenders were worn down by forty-eight
hours’ continual exertion, they held out till the evening
of the second day, when, the breach being assaulted by a
fresh body of 4,000 Dutch, Danish, and English troops,
selected from above 26,000 men, who fought in successive
detachments, against but three hundred or four hundred,
with no fresh troops to relieve them, these gallant
few did not abandon the breach before above two hundred
of their number were killed or disabled. Then, in
spite of the enemy, the brave survivors made their way
to the bridge over the Shannon, maintained themselves
in front of it till they demolished two arches behind them,
and finally retired across the river by a drawbridge into
the Irish town, which was preserved by their heroism till
the coming up, soon after, of the Irish main army under
Lieutenant-General St. Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Having at last attained possession of Englishtown,
Baron De Ginkel proceeded without delay to bombard
the Connaught, and stronger, section of Athlone. His
cannonade knocked a portion of the grim old castle to
pieces, and did considerable other damage, but produced
no depressing effect on the resolute Irish garrison, commanded
by two such heroes as Colonel John Fitzgerald
and the veteran Colonel Grace, who acted as a volunteer.
The experienced Dutch general, fearing the appearance
on the scene of St. Ruth, with a relieving army, became
a prey to anxiety. Impressed by the spirit displayed by
the Irish troops, he knew there was little chance of forcing
the mutilated bridge by a direct assault, and he looked
for some means of flanking the place, either by a ford or
a bridge of boats. He did not have, at first, sufficient
material for the latter, so he “demonstrated” with detachments
of horse, toward Lanesborough, east of Athlone,
and Banagher west of it. The vigilance of the Irish
patrols at both points baffled his design.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, St. Ruth, who had been on the march from
Limerick for some days, at the head of 15,000 men, if we
are to believe King James’s Memoirs, appeared beyond
the Shannon and went into camp on a rising ground about
a mile and a half from the town. He was soon made
aware of the condition of affairs, and strengthened the
castle garrison. He also had an earthen rampart constructed
to protect the bridge and ford. The latter was
practicable at low water only, and the summer of 1691
was exceptionally dry. The river had never been known
to be so shallow within the memory of living man. This
fact alone should have warned the French general to be
exceptionally vigilant. He retired the brave Fitzgerald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>from the governorship, to which he appointed General
Wauchop—a good soldier, but not an Irishman—and the
French officers, Generals D’Usson and De Tesse, were
made joint commandants in the town. The apologists
for St. Ruth’s mistakes in front of Athlone claim that the
ill-fated chief gave orders to the French commandants to
level all the useless old walls near the bridge, but that
his orders were neglected. As is usual in such cases, disobedience
led to tragical results. Foiled in his attempt
at flank operations, Ginkel determined to assault the partially
destroyed bridge across the Shannon, which, under
cover of a tremendous cannon fire, he did. But it was
defended with Spartan tenacity. Attack after attack
failed. Movable covered galleries were tried, and these
contained planks wherewith to restore the broken arches.
Not less than nine English batteries, armed with heavy
guns, rained death on the Irish army, but still it stood
unmoved, although losing heavily. Under cover of the
fire of nearly fifty great guns, the English pontoniers,
protected also by their galleries, succeeded in laying planks
across the broken arches. They accounted their work
done, when suddenly out of the Irish trenches leaped
eleven men clad in armor, led by Sergeant Custume, or
Costy, who, according to Sullivan, called on them “to die
with him for Ireland.” They rushed upon the bridge and
proceeded to tear away the planks. Instantly, all the English
cannon and muskets sent balls and bullets crashing
upon them. The whole eleven fell dead—shattered by
that dreadful fire. Some planks still remained upon the
arches. Eleven more Irish soldiers leaped from their
works, and, following the example of their fallen comrades,
gained the bridge and sought to throw the planks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>into the river. Nine of these heroes were killed before
their work was accomplished. But the planks were floating
down the Shannon, and two heroic survivors of
twenty-two Homeric heroes regained the Irish lines!
Pity it is that their names have not come down to us.
Aubrey de Vere, in his fine poem, commemorating the exploit,
tells us that St. Ruth, who, with Sarsfield, witnessed
the glorious deed, rose in his stirrups and swore he had
never seen such valor displayed in the Continental wars.
Chaplain Story, with incredible meanness, tries to steal
the glory of this deed from the Irish army by saying that
the heroes were “bold Scots of Maxwell’s regiment.”
The slander has been sufficiently refuted by O’Callaghan,
Boyle, and other writers. Maxwell was a Scotchman, but
he commanded Irish troops exclusively, and there was not
a single Scotch battalion in the service of King James in
Ireland from first to last. For further information on
this point, the reader can consult O’Callaghan’s “Green
Book” and “History of the Irish Brigades,” and also Dalton’s
“King James’s Irish Army List,” which gives the
roster of the field, line, and staff officers of each Irish regiment,
including Maxwell’s. The defence of the bridge
occurred on the evening of June 28. On the morning of
the 29th another attempt was to have been made, but,
owing to some miscalculation, was deferred for some
hours. St. Ruth was ready for it when it came, and, after
another murderous struggle at the bridge, where the English
and their allies were led by the Scottish General
Mackay, the assailants were again beaten off, their covered
gallery destroyed, and their bridge of boats, which
they bravely attempted to construct in face of the Irish
fire, broken up. St. Ruth commanded the Irish army in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>person and displayed all the qualities of a good general.
Success, however, would seem to have rendered him over-confident.
The conflict over, he led his main body back
to camp, and is said to have given a ball and banquet at
his quarters—a country house now in a neglected condition
and popularly known as “St. Ruth’s Castle.” The
Roscommon peasants still speak of it as “the owld house
in which the French general danced the night before he
lost Athlone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>By some unaccountable fatality, St. Ruth, instead of
leaving some veteran troops to occupy the works near
the bridge, committed them to new and untrained regiments,
which were placed under the command of Acting
Brigadier Maxwell. The latter, who has been—unjustly,
perhaps—accused of treason by Irish writers, would seem
to have shared the fatal over-confidence of St. Ruth.
Therefore, no extraordinary precautions were adopted
to prevent a surprise—something always to be anticipated
when a baffled enemy grows desperate. Colonel Cormac
O’Neill, of the great Ulster family of that ilk, happened
to be on duty at the defences of the river front during
the night and morning of June 29-30, and noticed suspicious
movements among the English troops occupying
the other side of the Shannon. Becoming alarmed, he
immediately communicated his suspicions to Maxwell,
observing, at the same time, that he would like a supply
of ammunition for his men. Maxwell sneered and asked,
“Do your men wish to shoot lavrocks (larks)?” However,
O’Neill’s earnest manner impressed him somewhat,
and, in the gray of the morning, he visited the outer
lines, and, from what he saw, at once concluded that
De Ginkel had some serious movement in contemplation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>He sent immediately to St. Ruth for a regiment of veteran
infantry, at the same time giving his reasons for
the request. St. Ruth, it is said, sent back a taunting
reply, which reflected on Maxwell’s courage. We are
told that Sarsfield remonstrated with St. Ruth, who declared
he did not believe Ginkel would make an attempt
to surprise the town, while he was so near with an army
to relieve it. English historians say that, upon this,
Sarsfield apostrophized British valor and remarked that
there was no enterprise too perilous for it to attempt.
The discussion—if, indeed, it ever took place—was cut
short by the ringing of bells and firing of cannon in
the town. “Athlone is surprised and taken!” Sarsfield is
credited with having said, as he observed the untrained
fugitives running from the Irish trenches. “Impossible!”
St. Ruth is represented to have replied, “Ginkel’s master
should hang him if he attempts the capture of the place,
and mine should hang me if I were to lose it!” But
the uproar from the city soon showed the Frenchman
that something terrible had occurred. When too late, he
gave orders to rectify his mistake. The English were
already in the works and could not be dislodged. Maxwell’s
men had fled in disorder, most of them being surprised
in their sleep, and the general and some of his
officers became prisoners of war. It was the most complete
and successful surprise recorded in military annals,
except, perhaps, that of Mannheim by General, afterward
Marshal, Ney, in 1799. It would seem that Ginkel,
by the advice of Mackay, and other officers, looked for
a ford, and found it by the aid of three Danish soldiers
who were under sentence of death, and were offered their
lives if they succeeded. They found the ford, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Irish, seeing them approach the bank of the river fearlessly,
concluded they were deserters and refrained from
firing. After them plunged in sixty armored English
grenadiers, led by Captain Sandys, a noted military dare-devil,
and these were followed by the main body under
Mackay, another experienced commander. The hour was
six in the morning of June 30, and, after one of the
bravest defences of which we have record, Athlone,
through the infatuation of St. Ruth, was in English
hands before noon on that eventful day. And so it came
to pass, that after a conflict of more than a year, the
defensive line of the Shannon was, at last, broken. It
is estimated by most historians that Ginkel’s total loss
amounted to 1,200 men and that of St. Ruth was somewhat
greater, owing to the surprise. Among those killed
in St. Ruth’s army were two colonels, named McGinness,
Colonel MacMahon, Colonel O’Gara, Colonel Richard
Grace, who fell in defence of the bridge on the 29th,
and the French adjutant-general. Few officers of note
fell on the English side. Ginkel, during the siege, “expended
50 tons of gunpowder, 12,000 cannon balls,
600 bombshells, and innumerable tons of stone, hurled
from the mortars, when the shells were exhausted.”
After the capture, the English found only a mass of
ruins, and it took De Ginkel several days to put the
place in some kind of repair.</p>

    <div>The Irish Army Falls Back and Takes Post at Aughrim—Description of the Field—Disposition of the Irish Forces—Baal Dearg O’Donnell’s Apathy</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>BOTH history and tradition affirm that St. Ruth and
Sarsfield almost came to swords’ points over the
loss of Athlone, and it is still believed, in that section
of Ireland, that the Irish general, indignant at the criminal
blunder that had been committed by his superior,
took all of his cavalry from under the Frenchman’s command
and marched to Limerick. But this tradition is
more than doubtful. It is, however, certain that the two
leaders, who should have been so united in council, had a
bitter altercation over the disaster, and were hardly on
speaking terms during the few momentous days they
were destined to serve together. St. Ruth was filled with
rage and mortification. He felt that he had committed
a grievous error, and dreaded the anger of King Louis,
who was a severe judge of those who served him ill.
He declared his determination to hazard all on a pitched
battle. Against this resolve, Tyrconnel, who had come
to the camp from Limerick, and others, protested, but
in vain. St. Ruth was in no humor to be balked. Tyrconnel
left the camp in dudgeon and retired once more
to Limerick, which he was destined never to leave again.
Having made up his mind to fight, St. Ruth at once broke
camp and moved by Milton Pass, where he halted for a
night, toward Ballinasloe, which stands on the river Suck
and in the county of Galway. The cavalry covered the
retreat, but no attempt whatever was made at pursuit.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The army took post along the fords of the Suck, as if
it intended to fight in front of Ballinasloe, which was considered
quite defensible, but St. Ruth’s previous knowledge
of the country would appear to have determined him
to retire about three and a half miles south by west of
his first position, as soon as reinforcements, drawn from
the abandoned, or reduced, posts along the Shannon, had
joined him. In his retreat from Athlone, some of the
Connaught troops, disgusted by the loss of that town and
doubtful of the general’s motives, deserted, and these
had to be replaced by the soldiers of the Irish garrisons
broken up or depleted. About July 9, old style, St.
Ruth decamped from Ballinasloe, and a few hours afterward
his devoted army, which, according to our best
information, consisted of about 15,000 foot and 5,000
horse and dragoons, with only nine field-pieces, defiled
by the causeways of Urachree and Aughrim to the slopes
of Kilcommodan Hill, where the new camp was established,
on the eastern side of the eminence, facing toward
Garbally and Ballinasloe. Kilcommodan, at that period,
was almost surrounded by red bog, and, on the front by
which De Ginkel must approach, ran a small stream, with
several branches, which made the morass impracticable
for horse and difficult for infantry. In our day, this
morass has become meadow-land, but it is about the only
natural feature that has undergone considerable change
since the period of the battle. From north to south, the
hill is estimated to be a little more than a mile in length,
and its mean elevation is about 350 feet. The bog lay
closer up to Aughrim, where stand the ruins of an old
castle which commanded the narrow and difficult pass,
than to Urachree, where there is another pass not particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>formidable to a determined assailant. The
road through the pass of Aughrim ran then, and still
runs, by Kilconnell Abbey and village—after which the
French have named the battle—to Athenry, Loughrea,
and Galway. The road through the pass of Urachree
connects Ballinasloe with Lawrencetown, Eyrecourt, and
Banagher Bridge, and also, by a branch route, with Portumna;
and these were the natural lines of retreat for the
Irish army in the event of disaster. Near the crest of
Kilcommodan Hill are the remains of two so-called Danish
raths, circular in shape, and in the one nearest to
Aughrim Castle St. Ruth is said to have pitched his tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of the elevation was then a wild common, but at
its base, on the Irish front, were many fields under tillage,
and these small inclosures were divided from each other
by thick, “quick-set” hedges, or, rather, fences, such as
are still common in Ireland—formidable against the encroachments
of cattle, but still more formidable when
applied to military purposes. The French general had
found his intrenchments ready-made, and proceeded to
use them to the best possible advantage. Weak points
in them were strengthened, and passageways connecting
one with the other, from front to rear and from right to
left, were constructed. The design was to enable the
formidable Irish cavalry to aid the infantry when a crisis
should arrive. In the direction of Urachree, St. Ruth
caused the construction of regular breastworks, conceiving
that his point of danger lay to the right, and having,
as a military writer has well observed, “a fatal confidence
in the strength of his left flank,” resting as it did
on an old castle and “a narrow, boggy trench through
which two horsemen could hardly ride abreast.” All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>his arrangements were completed by the 10th of July,
and, according to Boyle, the author of “The Battlefields
of Ireland,” his line of battle, which contemporaneous
accounts say covered a front of about two miles, had its
right resting on Urachree and its left upon Aughrim.
The London “Gazette” of July, 1691, says that this wing
of the Irish army “extended toward the Abbey of Kilconnell,”
which was considerably to the left and almost
in rear of Kilcommodan Hill. The Irish centre rested
on the mid slope of the elevation, “between its camp and
the hedgerows.” Each division consisted of two front
and two rear lines; the former of infantry and the latter
of cavalry. Of St. Ruth’s nine brass pieces, two were
devoted to the defence of Aughrim Castle; a battery of
three pieces was constructed on the northeastern slope of
Kilcommodan, so as to rake the castle pass, a part of the
morass, and the firmer ground beyond it, and thus prevent
any hostile troops from deploying there and so
threaten his left. His other battery, of four pieces, was
planted on his right and swept the pass leading to Urachree.
It is said that a strong reserve of horse, under
Sarsfield, was posted on the west side of the hill, out
of view of the approaching enemy, but that Sarsfield had
been particularly enjoined by St. Ruth to make no movement
whatever without a direct order from himself.
Story, who ought to know, says that Sarsfield was second
in command, but neither to him nor to any other
of his subordinate generals did St. Ruth communicate
his plan of battle, so that, if he were doomed to fall, the
conflict could still be waged as he had from the first ordained
it. This was St. Ruth’s most fatal error, as it
placed the fate of Ireland on the life or death of a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>man. He had no cannon with which to arm a battery on
his centre, nor does he seem to have wanted any for
that purpose—his apparent plan being to let the English
infantry cross at that point, where he felt confident the
Irish foot and dragoons would soon make an end of
them. Although King James’s memoirs aver that St.
Ruth had “a mean [<i>i.e.</i> poor] opinion” of the Irish infantry,
until it developed its prowess in the battle, his disposition
of this arm at Aughrim would not convey that
opinion to the observing mind. Most of the Irish foot
lacked discipline, in the strict sense of the term, but no
general who had seen them fight, as St. Ruth did, at the
bridge of Athlone, could doubt their courage. His expectation
that the English troops sent against his centre
would be roughly handled was not doomed to disappointment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Owing to many untoward causes, a full and correct
list of the Irish regiments that fought at Aughrim is not
to be obtained, but Boyle holds that Colonel Walter
Bourke and his brother, Colonel David Bourke, held the
position in and around the castle of Aughrim; that Lord
Bophin, Brigadier Henry Luttrell, and Colonels Simon
Luttrell and Ulick Bourke commanded on the left; that
Major-General Dorrington, Major-General H. M. J.
O’Neill, Brigadier Gordon O’Neill, Colonel Felix O’Neill,
and Colonel Anthony Hamilton held the centre; and that
Lords Kilmallock, Galmoy, Galway, Clare, and Colonel
James Talbot commanded on the right, toward Urachree.
Thus it may be inferred, says the historian, that the Munster
troops were on the right, the Leinster and Ulster contingents
in the centre, and the soldiers of Connaught were
posted on the left. The general in command of the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>infantry was William Mansfield Barker, and Major-General
John Hamilton was in chief command of the horse.
The discord among the chief officers in the Irish camp
must have been something unusual, when to none of the
distinguished commanders enumerated did the French
commander-in-chief reveal his order of battle. But the
historian recently quoted says, in reviewing the character
of the unfortunate Frenchman: “Whatever were the foibles
of St. Ruth, from his advent in the country to his
retreat from Athlone, we have now to look on an entirely
different character. He had learned, though at a fearful
cost, that his name had no fears for his potent adversary;
that deeds alone were to be the test of high emprise,
and that his folly had narrowed down the campaign, and
in fact the whole war, to the last resource of fallen
heroes—death or victory. With this feeling, all that was
vainglorious in his character at once disappeared; the mist
was removed from his mind, and it shone out to the end
of his short career as that of a true hero in adversity.
Unlike his French predecessors, he scorned to hide his
faults behind the shield of calumny; he candidly acknowledged
his error and bitterly lamented it. He became
courteous to his officers, affable to his soldiers, changed
at once from the despot to the patriarch, and, touched by
his sorrows, as much as by their own calamity, they again
rallied round him and determined on a final throw for religion
and liberty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A proclamation issued by the English Lords Justices, in
the name of William and Mary, immediately after the fall
of Athlone, offered inducements, in the shape of promotion
and money, to such officers and soldiers of the Irish
army as would desert their colors and accept service with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>De Ginkel. Very few traitors availed themselves of the
offer, but many of those who were indignant with St.
Ruth abandoned the camp and joined the irregular forces
of the military Hiberno-Spanish adventurer, Baal Dearg
O’Donnell, who claimed to be of the noble House of Tyrconnel,
and had lately come from Spain, apparently without
a settled purpose or principle. Instead of uniting his
7,000 irregulars with the regular Irish army under St.
Ruth, who had no French troops whatever with him,
O’Donnell assumed the airs of a hereditary Irish prince,
affected to despise James as well as William, and established
his camp and court in the country between Tuam
and Athenry, within two short marches, if made even in
ordinary time, of the Irish encampment on Kilcommodan
Hill. St. Ruth summoned him to his aid, but the adventurer,
whose selfish conduct some Irish writers, notably
Mr. Haverty, have sought to explain and excuse, made
no reply, and, to this day, he is remembered in Ireland
with detestation not unmingled with contempt. His
duty, when within sound of the cannon of Aughrim, was
to hasten to the field and spare the fate of his gallant
countrymen.</p>

    <div>De Ginkel Marches After St. Ruth—The Latter Prepares to “Conquer or Die”—His Speech to the Irish Army on the Eve of Fighting</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>REINFORCEMENTS continued to reach De Ginkel’s
camp near Athlone, where he lingered much
longer than he originally intended, owing to the utter
ruin which the bombardment had wrought. Another
cause of his delay was his anxiety to obtain fresh supplies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>of ammunition, and he judged correctly that St.
Ruth, rendered desperate by his late misfortune, would
give him decisive battle at the very first opportunity.
But, about July 10, all was in readiness, and leaving in
Athlone a powerful garrison, the Dutch general and his
fine army set out in pursuit of St. Ruth, who had now
so many days “the start” of his enemy. The English
halted that night at Kilcashel, on the road to Ballinasloe.
On the 11th they reached the fords of the Suck, and the
scouts reported the Irish pickets in full view on the
heights of Garbally—now the domain of the Earl of
Clancarty, whose ancestor distinguished himself as an
artillerist on the English side at Aughrim. De Ginkel,
taking with him a formidable force of cavalry, crossed
the river by the ford and rode forward to reconnoitre
St. Ruth’s position. The Irish pickets fell back as he
advanced, and, reaching the crest of the heights, he beheld,
through his field-glass, on an opposite elevation,
about a mile and a half distant, the Irish army drawn
up in “battle’s magnificently stern array,” matches lighted
at the batteries, and their colors advanced, challenging
to combat. He rode forward farther still, to get a closer
view, and St. Ruth allowed him to gratify his curiosity
unmolested, although he came within less than half a
mile of the Irish lines. What he saw made De Ginkel
thoughtful. His military glance showed him the strength
of the Irish position, and St. Ruth’s reputation as a competent
general stood high in all the camps of Europe.
He rode back to his camp and called a council of his
officers, Mackay, Ruvigny, Talmash, and the rest. Having
explained the situation, he asked for their opinion.
Some were for trying a flank movement, which would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>draw St. Ruth from his chosen ground, but the bolder
spirits said they had gone too far to turn aside without
loss of honor, and a forward movement was decided on.
The camp, guarded by two regiments, was left undisturbed.
All superfluous clothing was laid aside, and,
in light marching order, De Ginkel’s army crossed the
Suck, the movement being visible to St. Ruth from Kilcommodan
Hill, “the foot,” as Story has it, “over the
bridge; the English and French [Huguenot] horse over
the ford above, and the Dutch and Danes over two fords
below.” It was six o’clock in the morning of Sunday,
July 12, 1691 (July 23, new style), while the early
church bells were ringing in Ballinasloe, when they prepared
to march on Aughrim. English annalists, intending,
perhaps, to minimize the prowess of the Irish army,
place De Ginkel’s strength at 18,000 men of all arms,
but the roster of his regiments, as given by Story and
other contemporaneous writers, shows conclusively that
his force could not have been less than from 25,000 to
30,000 men, nearly all seasoned veterans. The Williamite
chaplain’s map of Ginkel’s order of battle shows over
seventy (70) regimental organizations, not including
Lord Portland’s horse, which joined after the line was
formed. Some of the bodies shown as regiments may
have been battalions or squadrons, but, making due allowance
for these, and counting 400 men as the average of
seventy distinct formations, which is an almost absurdly
low estimate, the Williamite army could not, possibly, have
been less than 28,000 men. Its artillery was formidable,
and the cavalry—British, Dutch, Danish, German, and
Huguenot—was accounted the best in Europe. As this
fine force advanced toward its objective, the scared rural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>folk fled before it, remembering, no doubt, the excesses
committed by the armies of William and Douglas in
Leinster and Munster during the preceding year. The
writer lived for some years almost within sight of Kilcommodan
Hill, and heard from the simple, but intelligent,
peasantry, whose great-grandfathers had spoken
with soldiers of King James’s army, how De Ginkel’s
troops defiled in four great, glittering columns of scarlet
and blue and steel, horse, foot, and cannoneers, over the
Suck and took up their positions on the Galway side of
the river. Their brass field-pieces shone like burnished
gold in the morning sun. They halted where the road
from Ballinasloe, running west by south, branches around
the north side of Kilcommodan, toward Kilconnell, Athenry,
and Galway, and around the south end of that elevation
toward Kiltormer, Lawrencetown, and Clonfert.
The Irish pickets fell back before them, firing as they
retired, from the heights of Knockdunloe, Garbally, and
Liscappel. De Ginkel marshaled his army into two lines
of battle, corresponding almost exactly to the Irish
formation, the infantry in the front line, and strongest,
finally, toward the centre, and the cavalry on the flanks,
supported by the cannon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Up to about 7.30 o’clock, tradition says, the morning
remained beautifully clear, and the Irish camp, on the
rising ground, was plainly visible to the enemy. St.
Ruth’s army, except the officers and men on duty and
the few non-Catholic Jacobites who followed its fortunes,
was observed to be assisting at mass—altars having been
erected by the chaplains at the head of every regiment.
It was, according to the imposing French custom, which
St. Ruth closely followed, military High Mass, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>which, at the elevation of the Host, there was rolling of
the drums and blare of trumpets, instead of the pealing
of cathedral bells. The horses of the Irish cavalry were
“on herd” along the grassy hillside, under guard; but,
when the English advance was sighted, the bugles
sounded “To Horse,” and there was “mounting in hot
haste” of Sarsfield’s and Galmoy’s and Kilmallock’s
bronzed and bearded troopers—the paladins of the
Boyne and Ballyneety. Divine service over, the Irish
army at once occupied the positions assigned to the several
corps by their general on the preceding day. Story
and some other English writers claim that, on that day,
also, St. Ruth addressed to his army a pompous, vainglorious,
and rather insulting speech, which he caused to
be translated into English and Irish, by his interpreters,
for the benefit of those to whom it was directed. But
Irish chroniclers aver that he spoke to the troops with
paternal consideration, reminded them of their country’s
sufferings, and their own duty, and called upon them,
in words of nervous eloquence, in the name of honor,
religion, and liberty, and for Ireland’s military glory,
to conquer or die.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>BUT the fog, “arising from the moist valley of the
Suck,” had, meanwhile, gathered so densely that the
rival armies, for a time, lost sight of each other, and De
Ginkel’s forward movement was suspended; but his soldiers
rested in the positions previously determined on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>although the formation had to be somewhat modified later
in the day. It was about noon when the fog finally rolled
away, and Ginkel’s line of battle moved slowly onward,
until, at last, to use the graphic words of Lord Macaulay,
the rival armies “confronted each other, with nothing but
the bog and the breastwork between them.” The Irish
historian, John Boyle, states, in his fine account of the
conflict at Aughrim, that, at sight of the Williamite array,
on the other side of the morass, the Irish army broke into
loud shouts of defiance, which were vigorously responded
to by their foes. There was a mutual mortal hatred expressed
in those cheers. It meant “war to the knife,”
and, as at our own Buena Vista,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Observing the strength of the Irish left at Aughrim
Castle, De Ginkel resolved to manœuvre toward Urachree,
where his horse had a better chance, and, about one
o’clock, began the battle with a cavalry advance in the
direction of the latter point. The first charge was made
by a Danish troop on an Irish picket. The latter met the
shock so fiercely that the Danes, although superior in
numbers, by the admission of Story, fled in great haste.
Another party was sent forward, and still another—the
Irish responding with fresh bodies of their own, until, at
last, Cunningham’s dragoons, Eppinger’s cavalry, and
Lord Portland’s horse—all under the veteran General
Holztapfel—were drawn in on the English side. They
charged furiously, and, for a moment, the Irish cavalry
gave ground, drawing their opponents after them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>English, carried away by apparent success, rode at a gallop
past the house of Urachree and were immediately
charged in flank by the brave Lord Galmoy. A murderous
conflict followed, but, as at the Boyne, the Irish
horsemen showed their superiority, and their gallant enemies
were forced to fall back in terrible disorder, leaving
hundreds of their comrades dead or dying on the ensanguined
field. Many of the Irish troopers fell also, and,
on both sides, every man was killed or wounded by the
sabre. The English left their heroic commander, General
Holztapfel, among their dead. When De Ginkel saw his
chosen cavalry repelled with slaughter from Urachree, he
became profoundly anxious. There had been, up to this
time, only a few partial demonstrations by the Anglo-Dutch
infantry which had produced no impression
whatever on St. Ruth’s sturdy foot, who lay quietly
in their works, waiting for their foes to advance to
closer quarters.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Ginkel, in deep distress of mind, summoned a council
of war, which debated whether it were better to defer
the battle until next day or renew the attack immediately.
At one time, during the discussion, it was determined
upon to send back to Ballinasloe for the tents, and encamp
for the night where the army stood. This decision
was afterward set aside, and, says Chaplain Story, “it
was agreed to prosecute the battel on the enemies’ right,
by that means proposing to draw part of their strength
from Aghrim [so he spells it] Castle, nigh which their
main body was posted, that so our right might have the
easier passage over to attack their left, and then our
whole army might have opportunity to engage. This, I
am told, was the advice of Major-General Mackay, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>man of great judgment and long experience, and it had
its desired success.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We will take the Williamite chaplain’s account of the
movement against the Irish right wing, which immediately
followed the council of war: “About half an hour
past four in the afternoon, a part of our left wing moved
toward the enemy, and, at five o’clock, the battel began
afresh. A party of our foot marched up to their ditches,
all strongly guarded with musketiers, and their horse
posted advantageously to sustain them: here we fired one
upon the other for a considerable time, and the Irish behaved
themselves like men of another nation [mark the
ungracious sneer], defending their ditches stoutly; for
they would maintain one side till our men put their
pieces over at the other, and then, having lines of communication
from one ditch to another, they would presently
post themselves again, and flank us. This occasioned
great firing on both sides, which continued on the left
nigh an hour and a half, ere the right of our army or the
centre engaged, except with their cannon, which played
on both sides. All this time, our men were coming up in
as good order as the inconveniency of the ground would
allow, and now General Mackay and the rest, seeing the
enemy draw off several bodies of horse and foot from the
left, and move toward their right, when our men pressed
them very hard; they [the English generals] laid hold
on that advantage, and ordered the foot to march over
the bogg, which fronted the enemies’ main battel. Colonel
Earl, Colonel Herbert, Colonel Creighton, and Colonel
Brewer’s regiments went over at the narrowest place,
where the hedges on the enemies’ side run farthest into
the bogg. These four regiments were ordered to march
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>to the lowest ditches, adjoining to the side of the bogg,
and there to post themselves till our horse could come
about by Aghrim Castle and sustain them, and till the
other foot marched over the bogg below, where it was
broader, and were sustained by Colonel Foulk’s and Brigadier
Stewart’s [forces]. Colonel Earl advanced with his
regiment, and the rest after him, over the bogg, and a
rivulet that ran through it, being most of them up to their
middles in mudd and water. The Irish at their near
approach to the ditches fired upon them, but our men
contemning all disadvantages, advanced immediately to
the lowest hedges, and beat the Irish from thence. The
enemy, however, did not retreat far, but posted themselves
in the next ditches before us, which our men seeing
and disdaining [<i>sic</i>] to suffer their lodging so near
us, they would needs beat them from thence also, and so
from one hedge to another, till they got very nigh the
enemies’ main battel. But the Irish had so ordered the
matter as to make an easy passage for their horse amongst
all those hedges and ditches, by which means they poured
in great numbers both of horse and foot upon us: which
Colonel Earl seeing, encouraged his men by advancing before
them, and saying: ‘There is no way to come off but
to be brave!’ As great an example of true courage and
generosity as any man this day living {1693}. But,
being flanked and fronted, as also exposed to the enemies’
shot from the adjacent ditches, our men were forced to
quit their ground, and betake themselves to the bogg
again, whither they were followed, or rather drove [<i>sic</i>]
down by main strength of horse and foot, and a great
many killed. Colonel Earl and Colonel Herbert were
here taken prisoners; the former, after twice taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>and retaking, got free at last, tho’ not without being
wounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“While this was doing here, Colonel St. John, Colonel
Tiffin, Lord George Hambleton, the French [Huguenots]
and other regiments were marching below on the same
bogg. The Irish, in the meantime, laid so close in their
ditches that several were doubtful whether they had any
men at that place or not; but they were convinced of it
at last; for no sooner were the French and the rest got
within twenty yards, or less, of the ditches, but the Irish
fired most furiously upon them, which our men as bravely
sustained, and pressed forwards, tho’ they could scarce
see one another for the smoak [<i>sic</i>]. And now the thing
seemed so doubtful, for some time, that the bystanders
would rather have given it on the Irish side, for they had
driven our foot in the centre so far back that they were
got almost in a line with some of our great guns, planted
near the bogg, which we had not the benefit of at that
juncture, because of the mixture of our men and theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Major-General Ruvigny’s French horse and Sir John
Lanier’s, being both posted on the right, were afterward
drawn to the left, where they did very good service.
And the right wing of our horse, in the meantime, were
making what haste they could to succor our foot; for,
seeing the danger, and, in fact, that all was in hazard by
reason of the difficulty of the pass, they did more than
men, in pressing and tumbling over a very dangerous
place, and that amongst showers of bullets, from a regiment
of dragoons and two regiments of foot, posted
conveniently under cover by the enemy, to obstruct our
passage. Our horse at this place were sustained by
Major-General Kirke and Colonel Gustavus Hambleton’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>foot, who, after we had received the enemies’ fire for a
considerable time, marched under the walls of the castle,
and lodged themselves in a dry ditch, in the throng of the
enemies’ shot [globular buttons cut from their jackets,
when their ammunition failed], and some other old walls
and ditches adjoining.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Commenting on the foregoing account of the Williamite
chaplain, Mr. O’Callaghan, in his “Green Book,” page
224, says: “He [Story] has the same fraudulent coloring
I have previously exposed respecting this [the Huguenot]
portion of the English left having ‘kept their
ground.’ The Huguenot narrative [of the battle] is only
wrong in the supposition that La Forest [Huguenot general]
on the English left was successful with the French
[Huguenot] infantry, before Ruvigny [Huguenot general],
with his horse, had conquered in the centre; the
first progress of the English having been on their right
opposite Aughrim ... where Sir Francis Compton with
the van and Mackay with the rest of the English horse
succeeded in forcing a passage; secondly, on the centre,
where Talmash next to Mackay, and Ruvigny next to
Talmash advanced; and, thirdly, on the left, where La
Forest first, and then the Danish horse and foot were enabled
to cross.”</p>

    <div>Battle of Aughrim Continued—Its Crisis—The English Turn Irish Left—St. Ruth Killed by Cannon Ball—Confusion and Final Defeat of Irish Army</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE lodgment made by the English, or, rather, Ulster
regiment of Gustavus Hamilton in the dry ditch, as
described by Chaplain Story, together with another lodgment
made in front of the Irish left centre by some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>the infantry who escaped the slaughter when they were
so gallantly repulsed at that point shortly before, however
effected, threw the chances of victory, for the first
time that day, heavily on the side of De Ginkel. St.
Ruth, whose sharp attention was, doubtless, mainly drawn
off toward his centre and right, where the battle had
raged fiercely and continuously for nearly two hours, soon
became aware of the movement inaugurated by the enemy’s
cavalry at the castle pass. He seemed astonished,
conceiving that the point was strongly garrisoned, and
asked of his officers: “What do they mean?” The reply
was: “They mean to pass there and flank our left!” St.
Ruth observed them for a moment, laughed incredulously,
having still “that fatal confidence in the strength of
his left flank,” and exclaimed in his impetuous fashion:
“Pardieu! but they are brave! What a pity they should
be so exposed!” A few minutes previously, exhilarated
by the splendid prowess of the Irish infantry, in the centre
and at Urachree, he threw his plumed hat in the air
and shouted: “Well done, my children! The day is
ours! Now we will beat them back even to the gates of
Dublin!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The unlooked-for passage of the English horse on the
Irish left has been variously explained, or, rather, sought
to be explained. Almost every Irish writer, the careful
O’Callaghan included, attributes the disaster to a lack
of proper ammunition on the part of Colonel Walter
Bourke’s regiment, to which was committed the defence
of the castle. Having exhausted their original supply,
the soldiers opened the barrels in reserve and found that
the bullets were cast for the calibre of the English guns
which they had used earlier in the war, and were too large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>for the bore of the French muskets, which they carried
at Aughrim. Other authors aver that when the Irish left
was weakened, to strengthen the right, the front instead
of the rear line of the covering brigade (Henry
Luttrell’s) was withdrawn, thus enabling the infantry
that accompanied Sir Francis Compton’s horse—who
were twice repulsed, but, being heavily reinforced, again
advanced—to post themselves in “the dry ditch” referred
to by Chaplain Story; while General Talmash made a
corresponding lodgment, with his rallied foot, on the
right centre. Gross carelessness, deliberate treason, or
both combined, contributed to the Irish disaster. St.
Ruth himself, however, would not seem to have been
much concerned by the apparition of the English cavalry
forming toward his left flank, in the small area of
firm ground, just across from the old castle. On the
contrary, like Napoleon before the final charge at Waterloo,
“the flash of victory passed into his eyes,” and, as
he observed the enemy forming with some difficulty in
that narrow space, while the single infantry regiment in
the dry ditch cowering under the rain of Irish bullets,
cried out to his staff, “We have won the battle, gentlemen!
They are beaten. Now let us beat them to the
purpose!” His bodyguard was formed in rear of the
staff and he had already ordered his cavalry reserve to
report to him. Therefore, these formidable squadrons
came up at a trot that shook the ground over the hill
behind him. We are not informed of the name of the
officer who led them—fortunately for his fame, for he
must have been either a dastard or a traitor. Instead of
committing the command to a subordinate general, as he
should have done, St. Ruth prepared to lead the attack in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>person, and the mass of horsemen, proud and confident,
began to move slowly down the slope in the direction of
the disheartened but still determined enemy. The general,
dismounting, halted for a brief space at the battery which
defended that flank of the army, addressed some remarks
to the officer in command, and, it is said, directed the
fire of one of the cannon, with his own hand, toward a
particular point of the causeway leading to the castle.
Then he remounted his superb gray charger—the third
he had ridden that fatal day—and, dressed as he was in
full uniform, made a conspicuous mark for the English
gunners. He drew his sword, his hard features, according
to tradition, kindling with enthusiasm, and was about
to utter the command to charge Compton’s and Levinson’s
cavalry—a charge that must have given the victory
to Ireland, because, according to Macaulay, De Ginkel
already meditated a retreat—when, right before the eyes
of his horrified followers, his head was dashed from his
shoulders by a cannon shot, fired from the English battery
at the other side of the bog! His sword remained
firmly gripped in his right hand, but his affrighted horse
galloped down the hill, the body of the rider remaining
erect in the saddle, until it was knocked off by the overhanging
branches of a tree whose remnants are still
pointed out to the traveler. A general paralysis of the
Irish left wing, chiefly among the horse, would seem to
have immediately followed the sudden and ghastly death
of St. Ruth. The French attendants at once threw a
cloak over the headless trunk, with the well-meant, but,
as it turned out, ill-considered object of concealing the
general’s unlooked-for fall from the all but victorious
Irish army.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>St. Ruth’s bodyguard halted the moment he fell,
and, when the servants bore the body over the hill toward
the rear, they acted as escort. The Irish horse,
through the timidity or treachery of their chief, halted
also, and, unaccountably, followed the movement in retreat
of the bodyguard. The single word “Charge!”
uttered by any general officer, before the cavalry retired,
would have saved the day; but it was never uttered.
The stubborn Mackay and his lieutenants, from their
position near the castle below, divined, from the confusion
they observed on the near hillside, that something
fatal had occurred. They took fresh heart. More of
their cavalry, strongly supported by infantry, came up.
All these reheartened troops began to push forward beyond
the pass, and even on their beaten centre and left
the long-baffled British and their allies again assumed
the offensive. No orders reached the Irish troops—mainly
foot—still in position on the right and centre
and even on a portion of the left—for the order of
battle had perished with St. Ruth. Was it possible that,
impressed by repeated dissensions, he doubted the fidelity
of his chiefs and feared to take any of them into his
confidence? He must have misjudged most of them sorely
if this was the case. Mere selfishness or vanity can not
explain his fateful omission. The English cavalry, now
practically unopposed, poured through the pass, penetrated
to the firm ground on the north slope of the hill,
and, finally, appeared in rear of the infantry of the Irish
left wing. Their foot, too, had succeeded in making
firm lodgment in the lowest ditches. The Irish still continued
to fight bravely, “but without order or direction.”
At the sight of the repeatedly routed British infantry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>crossing the bog in the centre, and the cavalry threatening
their left and rear, it is averred by Boyle that a cry
of “Treason!” rang through the ranks of the regiments
so placed as to be able to observe the hostile movements.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enemy now vigorously attacked the Irish right and
centre, but were as vigorously met, and again and again
repulsed. For a long time, on the right particularly, they
were unable to advance, and it would appear that the
Irish soldiers in their front were totally ignorant of what
had occurred in other parts of the field. The Irish infantry
on the left, destitute of ammunition and having
expended even their buttons and ramrods for projectiles,
retired within the castle, where nearly all of them were
finally slaughtered; or else broke off to the left, toward
Kilconnell, and made for the large, red bog, which almost
surrounded that flank, where many of them found refuge
from the sabres of the pursuing cavalry. But even still
the devoted centre and right, although furiously assaulted,
refused to give way. At last, the uproar toward
Aughrim, and the bullets of the outflanking enemy in
the left rear, taking them in reverse, warned these brave
troops that their position had become desperate. Twilight
had already set in—it was more than an hour after
the fall of St. Ruth—when the English horse and foot
appeared almost behind them, toward the northwest;
while the Dutch, Danish, and Huguenot cavalry, so long
repelled at Urachree, supported by the foot that had, at
long run, crossed the morass, began to hem them in on
all sides. Their bravest leaders had fallen, but this admirable
infantry retired slowly from inclosure to inclosure,
fighting the fight of despair, until they reached
their camp, where the tents were still standing in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>order in which they were pitched. Here they made their
last heroic stand, but were, at length, broken and fled
toward the red bog already mentioned. The English
leveled the tents, so as to render pursuit more open, and
then a dreadful slaughter of the broken Irish foot followed.
Few of these brave men, worthy of a better fate,
escaped the swords of the hostile horse. “Our foreigners,
and especially the Danes, make excellent pursuers,”
writes Chaplain Story grimly. Irish historians say that
two of the Irish regiments, disdaining to fly, took position
in a ravine, and there waited “till morning’s sun
should rise and give them light to die.” They were discovered
by the enemy next morning and perished to a
man! The spot where they died is still pointed out and
is called by the peasantry “the glen of slaughter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We have, unhappily, no better authority than tradition
for stating that, toward the end of the battle, a part of the
Irish cavalry, led by Sarsfield, covered the retreat of the
survivors of the Irish foot on Loughrea and Limerick.
In fact there seems to be a complete mystery about the
action of the Irish cavalry after the death of the French
general. Certain it is that this force did not act with the
vigor it showed in the early part of the combat on the
right or with the spirit it displayed at the Boyne; and this
fact deepens the doubt as to whether Sarsfield was in the
fight or not. Had it not been, as we are informed by the
learned Abbé McGeoghegan, in his able “History of
Ireland,” for one O’Reilly, the almoner of a regiment,
who caused the charge to be sounded as the fugitives
passed through a boggy defile on the line of retreat, the
entire Irish infantry might have been destroyed. They
were also aided by darkness, caused by “a thick misty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>rain,” brought on, no doubt, by the detonations of the
firearms, acting on a humid atmosphere. Numbers of
small arms and other munitions were abandoned in the
flight; all the cannon, most of the colors, and the whole
camp material fell into the hands of the enemy. Aughrim
was to Ireland what Culloden was to Scotland and Waterloo
to France—an irretrievable military disaster, redeemed
only by the desperate valor of the defeated army.
Even the most bitter and partisan of the English annalists
admit, although with manifest reluctance, that the Irish
army fought heroically in this murderous battle. Its losses
are placed by Story, who witnessed the conflict throughout,
at 7,000 killed on the spot and 500, including officers,
made prisoners. This statement of his shows conclusively
that almost all of the Irish wounded were put to
the sword. Other writers, including King James himself,
make the Irish loss somewhat less, but we are inclined
to think that Story, in this case, came pretty near to the
truth. He says in his interesting narrative, “looking
amongst the dead three days after, when all of ours and
some of theirs were buried, I reckoned in some small
inclosures 150, in others 120, etc., lying most of them
in the ditches where they were shot, and the rest from
the top of the hill, where their camp had been, looked like
a great flock of sheep, scattered up and down the country
for almost four miles round.” The bodies had been
stripped by the camp-followers, which accounts for the
white appearance to which Story makes allusion. Most
of these corpses were inhumanly left above ground, to be
the prey of birds and beasts, by the conquerors, and thus
Aughrim is known to the Irish people as the “Field of
our Unburied Dead.” It was customary a generation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>ago, and may be so in our day, for the Catholic peasantry
passing along the roads that wind around Kilcommodan,
to uncover their heads reverently and offer up
prayers for the souls of the heroes of their race who
died there for faith, land, and liberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Story says he never could find out what became of St.
Ruth’s corpse, “some say that it was left stripped amongst
the other dead when our men pursued beyond the hill,
and others that it was thrown into a bog.” In the neighborhood
of Aughrim it was long believed that while still
the left of the Irish army remained in position, the
French staff officers laid the remains to rest under the
chancel floor of the adjacent Abbey of Kilconnell. Other
traditions are to the effect that they were buried in Loughrea
Abbey, or beside those of Lord Galway, who fell in
the same battle, in the ruined church of Athenry. Boyle,
after mentioning the two last-named probabilities, says:
“There is, however, reason to doubt both, and the writer
is aware that the people of the locality where the battle
was fought, directed by tradition, point to a few stunted
white thorns, to the west of the hill toward Loughrea,
beneath which, they say, rest the ashes of that great but
unfortunate general.”</p>

in the list. Story omitted from the number of
superior officers slain the name of Colonel Felix O’Neill,
Judge-Advocate-General of the Irish army, whose body
was found on the field. Of the less than five hundred
Irish prisoners taken, twenty-six were general or field

<p class='c009'>Chaplain Story, to whom, with all his faults, we are
much indebted for the details of this momentous battle—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of the few “decisive battles” of the world—says:
“We [the English and their allies] lost 73 officers, who
were killed in this action, with 111 wounded, as appears
by the inserted lists [<i>vide</i> his History of the “Wars in
Ireland”] of both horse and foot, given in two days
after by the general’s command, and sent to the king.”
The lists referred to acknowledged, also, 600 soldiers
killed and 906 wounded. The allied losses were, no
doubt, underestimated for political effect in England,
which had been taught that one Englishman could kill
any number of Irishmen without much fear of a fatal
result to himself. And this superstition was useful, we
believe, to the morale of the British soldiers of the period,
whose stomachs failed them so notably when they
were “up against” the defences of Limerick, as will be
seen hereafter. Captain Taylor, a Williamite writer,
who was present at the battle and published a graphic account
of it, says that the loss of the allies (British, Dutch,
Danes, Germans, and Huguenots) was little less than
that of the Irish, most of the latter having fallen in the
retreat after the death of General St. Ruth. Of the
Anglo-Dutch troopers, there were killed by the Irish cavalry
at the pass of Urachree, in the early part of the
fight, 202, and wounded 125, thus showing the superior
strength, reach of arm, and dexterity of the Irish horsemen.
In hand-to-hand conflicts, whether mounted or
on foot, the Irish soldiery, in whatever service, ever excelled,
with sword or battle-axe, pike or bayonet. Clontibret
and the Yellow Ford, Benburb and Fontenoy, Almanza
and Albuera, Inkerman and Antietam bear witness
to the truth of this assertion. As a charging warrior,
the Irishman has never been surpassed, and, no matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>how bloodily repulsed, an Irish regiment or an Irish
army is ever willing to try again. There may be soldiers
as brave as they, but none are braver, even when
they fight in causes with which they have no natural sympathy.
It may be set down as a military axiom that the
Irish soldier is, by force of untoward circumstances, frequently
a mercenary, but rarely, or never, a coward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal officers who fell on the English side,
at Aughrim, were Major-General Holztapfel, who commanded
Lord Portland’s horse at Urachree; Colonel
Herbert, killed in the main attack on the Irish centre;
Colonel Mongatts, who died among the Irish ditches
while trying to rally his routed command; Major Devonish,
Major Cornwall, Major Cox, and Major Colt. Many
other officers of note died of their wounds at the field
hospital established on the neighboring heights of Garbally—now
converted into one of the most delightful
demesnes in Europe; and some who survived the field
hospital died in the military hospitals of Athlone and
Dublin. Those who fell in the battle were buried on the
field, with the usual military honors.</p>

<p class='c009'>Captain Parker, who fought in the English army in
this battle, and who has left a narrative, frequently quoted
by O’Callaghan, Haverty, Boyle, and other historians,
says: “Our loss was about 3,000 men in killed and
wounded,” and, as he was in the thick of the fight and
came out unwounded, he had full opportunity, after the
battle closed, to verify his figures. He certainly could
have no object in exaggerating the English loss, for the
tendency of all officers is to underrate the casualties in
their army. And Captain Parker says, further: “Had it
not been that St. Ruth fell, it were hard to say how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>matters would have ended, for, to do him justice, notwithstanding
his oversight at Athlone, he was certainly
a gallant, brave man, and a good officer, as appeared by
the disposition he made of his army this day.... His
centre and right wing [after his fall] still held their
ground, and had he lived to order Sarsfield down to sustain
his left wing, it would have given a turn to affairs
on that side”—“or,” O’Callaghan says in comment, “in
other words, have given the victory to the Irish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Macaulay—anti-Irish as all his writings prove
him to have been—says in his “History of England”:
“Those [the Irish] works were defended with a resolution
such as extorted some words of ungracious eulogy
even from men who entertained the strongest prejudices
against the Celtic race.” He then quotes Baurnett, Story,
and, finally, the London “Gazette,” of July, 1691, which
said: “The Irish were never known to fight with more
resolution.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In his interesting, but partial, “Life of William III,”
published in the beginning of the seventeenth century,
Mr. Harris, a fierce anti-Jacobite, says: “It must, in justice,
be confessed that the Irish fought this sharp battle
with great resolution, which demonstrates that the many
defeats before this sustained by them can not be imputed
to a national cowardice with which some, without reason,
impeached them; but to a defect in military discipline
and the use of arms, or to a want of skill and experience
in their commanders. And now, had not St. Ruth been
taken off, it would have been hard to say what the consequence
of this day would have been.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now we will give a few comments of the Irish historians
upon this Hastings of their country: O’Halloran,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>who was born about the time the battle was fought, and
who, as a native of Limerick, must have been, at least,
as familiar with soldiers who fought in the Williamite
wars as we are with the Union and Confederate veterans,
in Vol. I, page 106, of his “History of Ireland,” replying
to some slurs cast by the Frenchman, Voltaire, on the
Irish people, says: “He should have recollected that, at
the battle of Aughrim, 15,000 Irish, ill paid and worse
clothed, fought with 25,000 men highly appointed and
the flower of all Europe, composed of English, Dutch,
Flemings, and Danes, vieing with each other. That,
after a most bloody fight of some hours, these began to
shrink on all sides, and would have received a most complete
overthrow but for the treachery of the commander
of the Irish horse, and the death of their general [St.
Ruth] killed by a random shot.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On pages 532-533 of the same work, the historian says:
“Sir John Dalrymple tells us that [at Aughrim] the
priests ran up and down amongst the ranks, swearing
some on the sacrament, encouraging others, and promising
eternity to all who should gallantly acquit themselves
to their country that day. Does he mean this by way of
apology for the intrepidity of the Irish, or to lessen the
applause they were so well entitled to on that day? Have
they required more persuasions to fight the battles of
foreign princes than the native troops, or are they the
only soldiers who require spiritual comfort on the day
of trial? I never thought piety was a reproach to soldiers,
and it was, perhaps, the enthusiasm of Oliver’s troops
that made them so victorious. This battle was, certainly,
a bloody and decisive one. The stake was great, the
Irish knew the value of it, and, though very inferior to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>their enemies in numbers and appointments, and chagrined
by repeated losses, yet it must be owned they fought
it well. Accidents which human wisdom could not foresee,
more than the superior courage of their flushed enemies,
snatched from them that victory, which already
began to declare in their favor. Their bones yet (1744)
lie scattered over the plains of Aughrim, but let that
justice be done to their memories which a brave and
generous enemy never refuses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Abbé McGeoghegan, who wrote about 1745, and was
chaplain of the Franco-Irish Brigade, says in his “History
of Ireland,” page 603: “The battle began at one
o’clock, with equal fury on both sides, and lasted till
night. James’s infantry performed prodigies of valor,
driving the enemy three times back to their cannon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rev. Thomas Leland, an Irish Protestant divine, who
published a history of Ireland about 1763, after describing
the catastrophe which befell St. Ruth, says: “His
[St. R.’s] cavalry halted, and, as they had no orders,
returned to their former station. The Irish beheld this
retreat with dismay; they were confounded and disordered.
Sarsfield, upon whom the command devolved,
had been neglected by the proud Frenchman ever since
their altercation at Athlone. As the order of battle had
not been imparted to him, he could not support the dispositions
of the late general. The English, in the meantime,
pressed forward, drove the enemy to their camp,
pursued the advantage until the Irish, after an engagement
supported with the fairest prospect of success,
while they had a general to direct their valor, fled
precipitately.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Right Rev. Dr. Fitzgerald, Episcopalian bishop,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>in his “History of Limerick,” published some sixty years
ago, says: “It [Aughrim] was the bravest battle ever
fought on Irish soil.” The bishop, evidently, had not
read the lives of Art MacMurrough, Hugh O’Neill, Hugh
O’Donnell, and Owen Roe O’Neill, when he penned the
words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such,” writes O’Callaghan, at the conclusion of his
account of it, in the “Green Book,” page 230, “was the
battle of Aughrim, or Kilconnell, as the French called it,
from the old abbey to the left of the Irish position; a
battle unsuccessful, indeed, on the side of the Irish, but
a Chæronea, or a Waterloo, fought with heroism and
lost without dishonor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A. M. Sullivan, in his fascinating “Story of Ireland”
(American edition, page 458), says, or rather, quotes
from a Williamite authority: “The Irish infantry were
so hotly engaged that they were not aware either of the
death of St. Ruth or of the flight of the cavalry, until
they themselves were almost surrounded. A panic and
confused flight were the result. The cavalry of the right
wing, who were the first in action that day, were the last
to quit the ground.... St. Ruth fell about sunset
[8.10], and about 9, after three hours’ [nearer four
hours’] hard fighting, the last of the Irish army [who
were not killed, wounded, or captured] had left the field.”</p>

<p class='c009'>John Boyle, in his “Battlefields of Ireland,” quotes
Taylor, an English military author who fought at Aughrim,
as saying: “Those [the Irish dead] were nearly all
killed after the death of St. Ruth, for, up to that, the
Irish had lost scarcely a man;” and, says he, further,
“large numbers were murdered, after surrender and promise
of quarter, by order of General Ginkel, and among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>those, so murdered, in cold blood, were Colonel O’Moore
and that most loyal gentleman and chivalrous soldier,
Lord Galway.” This same able writer, in concluding
his graphic story of the famous battle, remarks, with indignant
eloquence: “It is painful to speculate on the cause
that left the Irish army without direction after the death
of St. Ruth. Many have endeavored to explain it, but
all—as well those who doubt Sarsfield’s presence on the
field as those who maintain the contrary—are lost in conjecture,
and none who participated in the battle, and survived
it, has placed the matter beyond speculation. So
leaving that point as time has left it, what appears most
strange in the connection is the absence of all command
at such a conjuncture. The disposition of the Irish troops,
though dexterous, was simple. The day was all but
won. The foiling of Talmash (Mackay) would have
been the completion of victory. A force sufficient was
on his front; a reserve more than ample to overwhelm
him was on its way to the ground—nay, drawn up and
even ready for the word. The few British troops that
held a lodgment in the hedges, at the base of the hill,
were completely at the mercy of those above them. It
required no omniscient eye to see this, nor a voice from
the clouds to impel them forward, and, surely, no military
etiquette weighed a feather in opposition to the fate
of a nation. Any officer of note could have directed the
movement, and many of experience and approved courage
witnessed the crisis. Yet, in this emergency, all the hard-won
laurels of the day were tarnished, and land and liberty
were lost by default! Nor can the rashness of St.
Ruth, his reticence as to his plans, his misunderstanding
with Sarsfield, nor the absence of the latter, justify the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>want of intrepid action among those present. This
stands unexplained and inexplicable, nor will the flippant
appeal to Providence, whose ways are too frequently offered
as an excuse for human misconduct, answer here.
The want of ammunition at such a moment was, no doubt,
of some import, but the concurrence of events too plainly
indicates that Aughrim was won by the skill of St. Ruth
and the gallantry of his troops, and that it was lost
through want of decision in his general officers, at a moment
the most critical in the nation’s history.”</p>

<p class='c009'>De Ginkel’s army remained in the neighborhood of
the field of battle long enough to give it an opportunity
of burying all of the Irish dead, were it so disposed. The
country-people remained away, in terror of their lives
and poor belongings—particularly cattle—until decomposition
had so far advanced as to make the task of sepulture
particularly revolting. And thus it came to pass
that nearly all the Irish slain were left above ground, “exposed
to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field;
many dogs frequenting the place afterward, and growing
so fierce by feeding upon man’s flesh that it became dangerous
for any single man to pass that way. And,”
continues Story in his narrative so frequently quoted,
“there is a true and remarkable story of a greyhound
[meaning the large, rapacious, and ferocious, Irish Wolf
Dog that existed in those days, although extinct since
the last century] belonging to an Irish officer: the gentleman
was killed and stripped in the battle, whose body
the dog remained by night and day, and tho’ he fed
on other corps [es] with the rest of the dogs, yet he
would not allow them, or anything else, to touch that of
his master. When all the corps [es] were consumed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>other dogs departed, but he used to go in the night to the
adjacent villages for food, and presently to return again
to the place where his master’s bones were only then left;
and thus he continued till January following, when one
of Colonel Foulk’s soldiers, being quartered nigh hand,
and going that way by chance, the dog, fearing he came
to disturb his master’s bones, flew upon the soldier, who,
being surprised at the suddenness of the thing, unslung
his piece, then upon his back, and killed the poor dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Ireland’s national poet, Thomas Moore, in the beautiful
words, set to that weirdly mournful air: “The Lamentation
of Aughrim,” thus pours out in deathless melody
the heart of his unfortunate country:</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE decisive battle having been lost by Ireland, what
followed in this campaign became almost inevitable.
Louis XIV and his ministers were criminally culpable in
encouraging the Irish people to resistance when they did
not mean to give them effective aid. Ireland had proved,
in breach and field, that she needed no foreign troops to
do her fighting, but she badly needed arms, ammunition,
quartermaster’s supplies, and a money-chest. Perhaps the
egotism of the French monarch and his advisers led them
to underrate the importance of Ireland as a factor in the
affairs of Europe, and the slanders of the perfidious Lauzun
and his lieutenants had poisoned the mind of the ruler
of France in regard to Irish valor. James, in his panic
flight, had also carried with him to the French court a
most unfavorable impression, and some Irish writers—among
them Mr. Boyle—aver that Louis bitterly reproached
the fallen king for his ignominious abandonment of Ireland
after the affair of the Boyne. James, however, managed
to conciliate his haughty cousin, and the latter made
him still more promises of effective assistance.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Ginkel, whose immediate objective, as before the
great battle, was Galway, broke up his camp at Aughrim
and marched to Loughrea, on July 16. He reached Athenry
the following day, and Oranmore on the 18th. At
this point he learned that Lord Dillon was Governor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Galway town, and that the French general, D’Usson, commanded
the garrison. Baal Dearg O’Donnell, with what
remained of his irregular force, hovered about the city,
but failed to throw himself into it. It has been stated,
on seemingly good authority, that the Irish officials within
the town distrusted him, as, indeed, was not unreasonable,
seeing that Chaplain Story tells us that “his [O’Donnell’s]
design was to keep amongst the mountains till he
could make terms for himself, upon which account he writ
[wrote] the general, De Ginkel, before our army removed
from Galway.” He followed up this treason in a practical
manner, and, some months later on, as the Chaplain
circumstantially informs us, the adventurer entered the
service of William in the Continental wars, and also received
a pension of £500 per annum, for life, from the
English treasury. The same consideration was subsequently
given to Brigadier Henry Luttrell, on whom popular
Irish tradition has fixed the odium of having “sold
the pass at Aughrim.” It is certain that twenty-six years
afterward, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1717, this treacherous “general of the Irish
horse” was shot to death in a sedan chair, while being
carried through the streets of Dublin. No doubt remains
among the Irish people that the deed was done in reprisal
for Luttrell’s villanous conduct in the campaign of 1691,
and some have gone so far as to charge him with having
been the officer who ordered the Irish cavalry off the field
immediately after the death of St. Ruth on Kilcommodan
Hill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Galway, before which De Ginkel appeared on the 19th,
after a respectable show of resistance, surrendered with the
honors of war, and sundry liberal civil provisions, on the
22d. On the 26th it was evacuated by the Irish garrison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>which marched to Limerick. This capitulation virtually
ended Irish resistance in Connaught, except for the town of
Sligo, which was stubbornly held by the gallant Sir Teague
O’Regan, the hero of Charlemont, against a strong detachment
of the English army, under Lord Granard, until the
following September 16, when he, too, having done all that
a brave commander might, yielded his post with honor, and
was allowed to join the main Irish army in Limerick town.
The adventurer, O’Donnell, assisted the English against
Sligo. De Ginkel, after garrisoning Galway, moved toward
Limerick by way of Athenry, Loughrea, Eyrecourt, Banagher
Bridge, Birr, Nenagh, and Caherconlish, meeting
but feeble resistance on his route. He halted at the last-mentioned
place to refresh and reinforce his army, and to
provide himself with a stronger siege train. This he finally
brought up to the number of sixty “great guns,” none of
them less than a twelve-pounder, and about a score of mortars
for the throwing of large shells. About this time, he issued
several proclamations, and continued to do so throughout
the subsequent operations, with the design of seducing
the Irish officers and soldiers from their allegiance to a
desperate cause. In this effort he was by no means successful,
but several clever Irish spies passed themselves off
as deserters, and gave him plenty of misinformation regarding
the condition of affairs at Limerick. While in
this camp at Caherconlish, the Dutch general’s attention was
called to the cupidity of the sutlers and other camp-followers,
who appear to have been as greedy and conscienceless
as their successor of our own times. The gossipy Chaplain
informs us, in this connection, that General Ginkel “sent out
an order that all ale from Dublin and Wicklow should be
sold at 6 pence [12 cents] per quart; all other ale, coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>above forty miles, at 5 pence, and all under forty miles at
4 pence; white bread to be sold at 3 pence per pound; brown
bread at 2 pence; claret at 2 shillings and 6 pence, and
Rhenish at 3 shillings [per quart]; brandy at 12 shillings
[$2.88] per gallon, etc.; and that no person should presume
to exceed these rates on the penalty of forfeiting all his
goods, and suffering a month’s imprisonment. But they
promptly found out a trick for this,” continues Mr. Story
in disgust, “and called <i>all</i> drink that came to the camp
Dublin or Wicklow ale!” This “touch of nature” shows
how little mankind has changed in principle and practice
after a lapse of more than six generations.</p>

<p class='c009'>De Ginkel appeared in front of Limerick on August 25,
and the city was immediately invested on the south, east,
and north. The Clare side, connected by Thomond Bridge
with Englishtown, or King’s Island, still remained unattacked,
as no English force had passed the river. The Irish
horse and dragoons were all quartered on that side, while
the infantry garrisoned the threatened portions of the city.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding the imposing array of Ginkel’s superb
army and powerful siege equipment as they approached
the walls of their city, neither the people nor the garrison
of Limerick seem to have been much concerned by the
spectacle. The walls were much stronger than they had
been in the previous siege, and the soldiers were seasoned
to hardship and peril. D’Usson, the French lieutenant-general,
was in chief command, with his fellow-countryman,
general, the Chevalier De Tessé, second, and Sarsfield, it appears
from the order of signature in the subsequent treaty,
was third in rank, with the Scotch general, Wauchop,
fourth. The Duke of Tyrconnel had died of apoplexy—Story
hints at poison administered in wine—after dining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>heartily with the French generals and other officers on
August 14. The misfortunes of his country, in the opinion
of many writers, had more to do with hastening the
end than any other cause. His remains lie under a nameless
flagstone in the aisle of St. Mauchin’s church in Limerick,
but we are informed not even Irish tradition, usually
so minute, can point out the exact place of sepulture. The
powerful English batteries, raking the town on three sides,
poured in torrents of bombs and red-hot cannon balls, day
and night, and the place caught fire at several points. Most
of the women and children had to be removed to the cavalry
camp on the Clare bank, and the casualties among the
defenders were numerous. The Irish replied spiritedly,
but they were very deficient in weight of metal, and, also,
because of the comparative shortness of supply, had to be
sparing of their ammunition, whereas the English were
always sure of a fresh supply both from the interior and
their men-of-war on the adjacent coasts. The Chaplain,
under date of September 8, 1691, relates how the “new
batteries were all ready—one to the left with ten field-pieces
to shoot red-hot ball; another to the right of 25 guns, all
24 and 18-pounders; and in the centre were placed 8 mortars,
from 18¾ to 10½ inches in diameter; these stood
all together on the northeast of the town, nigh the island;
then there were 8 guns of 12-pound ball each, planted at
Mackay’s fort, and some also toward the river on the
southwest, where the Danes were posted. These fell to
work all the time and put the Irish into such a fright [more
partisan venom] that a great many of them wished themselves
at another place, having never heard such a noise
before, nor I hope never shall in that kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Three days later the reverend chronicler tells us that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>“the breach was widened at least forty paces, and, floats
being prepared, there were great debates amongst the chief
officers whether it should be attempted by storm....
Though indeed we could not do the enemy a greater pleasure,
nor ourselves a greater prejudice, in all probability,
than in seeking to carry the town by a breach, before those
within [the Irish, to wit] were more humbled, either by
sword or sickness.” No finer tribute than this, coming
from such a source, could be paid to Irish constancy and
courage, after such treasons and disasters as marked the
capture of Athlone and the loss of Aughrim.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thoroughly convinced that he could not hope to carry
Limerick by direct assault, De Ginkel now resolved to test
the never-failing weapon of treachery and surprise on this
stubborn foe. He had information that there was a strong
peace-at-any-price party within the town, and that, could
he but land a strong force on the Clare bank of the Shannon,
the city would speedily capitulate. He, therefore, determined
to construct, in all secrecy, a pontoon bridge across
the river above St. Thomas Island, near a place called
Annaghbeg, where Brigadier Robert Clifford commanded
a strong body of Irish dragoons and infantry, quite sufficient,
if only properly directed, to foil any hostile movement.
On the night of the 15th of September, the bridge
was laid—the most favorable point having been revealed
by some fishermen, who, the historian O’Callaghan relates,
were bribed to betray their country. It is much more probable,
however, that they were forced to turn traitors under
threat of death. However, on the morning of the 16th the
bridge was completed and a formidable English force of
horse and foot, under Generals Talmash and Scravenmore,
succeeded in crossing. Apparently taken by surprise—although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>distinctly charged with treason by numerous Irish
historians—General Clifford, at this important juncture,
displayed neither zeal, courage, nor capacity. He brought
his men up in a state of unreadiness and in detachments,
instead of in a solid formation, and, of course, was easily
put to rout. To show the criminal carelessness, to say no
worse, of this commander, his cavalry horses were “out at
grass” two miles from his camp, when the English attack
was made! Such “generalship” would have demoralized
an army of Spartans, and the Irish rank and file can hardly
be blamed if, on this occasion, they did not manifest their
customary intrepidity. Europe never beheld in the field a
braver body of men than King James’s Irish army, and
the world never furnished a more incompetent staff of general
officers, whether French or Irish, than that which commanded
and, finally, wrecked it. We wish to except St.
Ruth and Sarsfield and Boisseleau, who were able and gallant
soldiers, thoroughly devoted to the cause in which
they had embarked. De Ginkel’s bold movement resulted
in the partial turning of Thomond Bridge—the key to King’s
Island—and the capture of St. Thomas Island, another important
Irish post above the city. He, therefore, felt justified
in issuing, that same day, a proclamation inviting the
garrison of Limerick to surrender on honorable conditions,
but the Irish, although now under a veritable rain of fire
and iron from every point of the compass, paid no heed to
it, whereat the phlegmatic, but skilful, Dutch strategist
greatly marveled.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, although the river had been successfully passed, Ginkel
was so discouraged by the firm countenance of the Irish
garrison that he called a Council of War on the 17th, when
it was, at first, decided to cross the whole English army
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>into Clare, destroy the Irish resources of food and forage
in that county, and then convert the siege into a blockade
that might last indefinitely. Reflection, however, changed
this decision. Winter was approaching, and the wet Irish
winter meant wholesale death to the soft and pampered English
and their foreign allies. Ginkel, then, resolved to
again try his favorite manœuvre—a turning movement.
Accordingly, on September 22, at the head of the greater
portion of the allied army, he crossed the pontoon bridge
and, commanding in person, made a sudden and tremendous
attack on the small fort which commanded Thomond
Bridge, and was garrisoned by about 800 Irish soldiers.
The English cannon soon covered this fort with red-hot
projectiles. Everything inflammable in the soldiers’ quarters
caught fire, and the desperate garrison made a sortie
with the object of crossing into King’s Island by Thomond
Bridge. The connection was by means of a draw. A little
over a hundred of the Irish had crossed in safety, when
the French major in command at the drawbridge, fearing,
it is said, that the English might enter the town with the
fugitives, caused it suddenly to be raised. The men behind
were not able to see what had happened, and the foremost
ranks that stood on the western abutment were forced over
the gulf and nearly all perished in the river. The others
put up white handkerchiefs in token of surrender, but the
savage victors showed no mercy. Story, who saw the whole
sickening butchery, paints the scene in ghastly fashion
thus: “Before the killing was over, they [the Irish] were
laid in heaps upon the bridge, higher than the ledges of
it.” Out of 800 men, only the five score and odd that
gained the drawbridge in time, and the few strong ones
who swam the river, escaped. It, on a smaller scale, resembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>the disaster at Leipsic, in 1813, when the French
Major of Engineers, Montfort, caused the bridge over the
Elster to be blown up, while yet the corps of MacDonald
and Poniatowski, which formed Napoleon’s rearguard, were
on the hostile bank of the river. Thus, through the stupidity,
or panic, of a subordinate officer, the emperor lost
the Polish marshal, who was one of his best generals,
and 20,000 of his choicest troops. A fool or coward commanding
at a bridge over which an army is compelled to
retreat, is more deadly to his friends than all the bullets
and sabres of the enemy.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Capitulation of Limerick—Terms of the Famous “Violated Treaty”—Cork Harbor Tragedy</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE Irish cavalry, which would seem to have been
inefficiently commanded by General Sheldon during
the late operations, and now completely outnumbered, fell
back to Six-Mile-Bridge in Clare, dejected and almost hopeless.
The men had lost faith in their commanders, and
that meant a speedy end of effective resistance. When it
became known in Limerick that the enemy had been
successful beyond the river, the peace party began again
to clamor loudly for a capitulation. A party eager for surrender
within a beleaguered city is the very best ally a besieging
force can have. In this case, their treason or pusillanimity
proved the destruction of their country. De Ginkel
had positive information that a great French fleet, under
a renowned admiral, Count Chateau-Renaud, was fitting out
at Brest for the relief of Limerick. Therefore he was ready
to promise almost anything in order to gain the timely surrender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>of the place, for he knew that if the French once
landed in force, all the fruits of his recent victories would be
irretrievably spoiled. The buoyant Irish would rally again
more numerously than ever, better drilled, equipped, and
thoroughly inured to war. His good opinion of their
fighting qualities was unequivocally shown in his eagerness
to enlist them as soldiers under the banner of King William.
He felt morally certain that Sarsfield and the other chief
Irish officers were entirely ignorant of the preparations
going on in France. They imagined themselves absolutely
deserted by that power. Irish tradition credits General Sarsfield
with a disposition to hold out to the last, while it is
believed, on the same rather unreliable authority, that the
French generals, D’Usson and De Tessé, favored an honorable
and immediate surrender. It is certain that most
of the Anglo-Irish officers were tired of the war and desired
to have an end of it on any reasonable terms. Ginkel was
still over the river in Clare, when, on the evening of September
23, the Irish drums, from several points in the town,
beat a parley. The siege had lasted almost a month, and
the English officers were delighted at the near prospect of
peace. They received Sarsfield, Wauchop, and their escort,
under a flag of truce, with military courtesy, and directed
them where to find the general-in-chief. The Irish officers
crossed the Shannon in a rowboat, and found Ginkel in his
camp by Thomond Bridge. He received them favorably,
and a temporary cessation of hostilities was agreed upon.
Next morning, it was decided to extend it three days. Then
it was determined that the Irish officers and commands separated
from the Limerick garrison should be communicated
with, and that all, if terms were agreed upon, would surrender
simultaneously. Meanwhile the English and Irish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>officers exchanged courtesies and frequently dined together,
although the French generals held aloof, for some reason
that has never been satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p class='c009'>But now the ultra peace party having, in a measure, the
upper hand, sought to commit the Irish army to a dishonorable
and ungrateful policy—the abandonment of France,
which, with all its faults, was Ireland’s sole ally. Hostages
were exchanged by the two armies, those for England being
Lord Cutts, Sir David Collier, Colonel Tiffin, and Colonel
Piper; and for Ireland Lords Westmeath, Iveagh (whose
entire regiment afterward passed over to William), Trimelstown,
and Louth. Following the arrival of the latter in
the English camp came the peace party’s proposals, which
stipulated for the freedom of Catholic worship and the
maintenance of civil rights, and then basely proposed that
“the Irish army be kept on foot, paid, et cetera, the same as
the rest of their majesties’ forces, in case they were willing
to serve their majesties against France or any other
enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish army, nobly chivalrous and patriotic, with the
usual base exceptions to be found in every considerable
body of men, was not willing “to serve their majesties” as
intimated, as will be seen further along. Ginkel, who was
thoroughly coached by the “royal commissioners” from
Dublin, who were rarely absent from his camp, rejected the
Palesmen’s propositions, chiefly because of the Catholic
claims put forward in them. There is no evidence whatever
that Sarsfield countenanced the policy attempted to be
carried out by this contemptible faction.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the 28th all the parties in Limerick town came to an
agreement in regard to what they would propose to and accept
from De Ginkel. The latter, who was quite a diplomatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>as well as military “bluffer,” began openly to prepare his batteries
for a renewal of the bombardment—the three days’
cessation having nearly come to an end. But, on the day
stated, there came to him, from out of Limerick, Generals
Sarsfield (Lord Lucan), Wauchop, the Catholic Primate,
Baron Purcell, the Archbishop of Cashel, Sir Garret Dillon,
Sir Theobald (“Toby”) Butler, and Colonel Brown, “the
three last counselors-at-law, with several other officers and
commissioners.” Baron De Ginkel summoned all of his
chief generals to meet them, and “after a long debate, articles
were agreed on, not only for the town of Limerick, but
for all the other forts and castles in the kingdom, then in
the enemies’ possession.” In compliance with the wish of
the Irish delegation, De Ginkel agreed to summon the
Lords Justices from Dublin to ratify the treaty. These
functionaries, authoritatively representing King William
and Queen Mary, soon arrived at the camp and signed the
instrument in due form. The French generals, although
they did not accompany the Irish commissioners on their
visit to Ginkel, signed the terms of capitulation with the
rest, the names appearing in the following order: D’Usson,
Le Chevalier de Tessé, Latour Monfort, Mark Talbot, Lucan
(Sarsfield), Jo Wauchop, Galmoy, M. Purcell. For
England there signed Lords Justices Charles Porter and
Thomas Conyngsby, Baron De Ginkel, and Generals Scravenmore,
Mackay, and Talmash.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Treaty of Limerick was thus consummated on October
3, 1691, with all the required forms and ceremonies,
so that no loophole of informality was left for either party
to this international compact. In the treaty there were 29
military and 13 civil articles. As they were quite lengthy,
we will confine ourselves to a general summary, thus:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>All the adherents of King James in Ireland were given
permission to go beyond the seas to any country they might
choose to live in, except England and Scotland. Volunteers
and rapparees were included in this provision, as well as the
officers and soldiers of the Irish regular army. These voluntary
exiles were allowed to depart from Ireland in “whole
bodies, companies, or parties;” and it was provided that, if
plundered by the way, the English Government would grant
compensation for such losses as they might sustain. It was
agreed that fifty ships of 200 tons burden each should be
provided for their transportation, and twenty of the same
tonnage in addition, if it should be found necessary, and
that “said ships should be furnished with forage for horses
and all necessary provisions to subsist the officers, troopers,
dragoons, and [foot] soldiers, and all other persons [meaning
families and followers] that are shipped to be transported
into France.” In addition, two men-of-war were placed
at the disposal of the principal officers for the voyage, and
suitable provision was made for the safe return of all vessels
when their mission of transportation was accomplished.
The thrifty De Ginkel further stipulated that the provisions
supplied to the military exiles should be paid for by their
government as soon as the Irish troops were landed on
French soil. Article XXV provided: “That it shall be lawful
for the said garrison [of Limerick] to march out at once,
or at different times, as they can be embarked, with arms,
baggage, drums beating, match lighted at both ends, bullet
in mouth, colors flying, six brass guns, such as the besieged
shall choose, two mortar pieces, and half the ammunition
that is now in the magazines of the said place.” This provision,
which, as can be seen, included the full “honors of
war,” was also extended to the other capitulated Irish garrisons.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Another significant provision was that all Irish officers
and soldiers who so desired could join the army of
King William, retaining the rank and pay they enjoyed in
the service of King James.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the civil articles, the first read as follows: “The Roman
Catholics of this kingdom shall enjoy such privileges
in the exercise of their religion as are consistent with the
laws of Ireland, or as they did enjoy in the reign of King
Charles II; and their Majesties, as soon as their affairs
will permit them to summon a Parliament in this kingdom,
will endeavor to procure the said Roman Catholics such
further security in that particular as may preserve them from
disturbance upon the account of their said religion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The second article guaranteed protection in the possession
of their estates and the free pursuit of their several professions,
trades, and callings to all who had served King James,
the same as under his own régime, on the taking of the
subjoined oath of allegiance prescribed by statute: “I ——
do solemnly promise and swear that I will be faithful and
bear true allegiance to their Majesties, King William and
Queen Mary: so help me God.” A subsequent article provided
that “the oath to be administered to such Roman
Catholics as submit to their Majesties’ government shall be
the oath aforesaid and no other”—thus doing away, as the
Irish honestly supposed, with the odious penal “Test oaths,”
which were an outrage on Catholic belief and a glaring insult
to the Catholics of the whole world.</p>

<p class='c009'>The third article extended the benefit of the first and
second articles to Irish merchants “beyond the seas” who
had not borne arms since the proclamation issued by William
and Mary in the preceding February, but they were
required to return to Ireland within eight months.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Article IV granted like immunity to Irish officers in
foreign lands, absent in pursuance of their military duties,
and naming, specially, Colonel Simon Luttrell (the loyal
brother of the traitor, Henry), Colonel Rowland White,
Colonel Maurice Eustace, of Gormanstown, and Major
Cheviers (Chevers) of Maystown, “commonly called Mount
Leinster.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Article V provided that all persons comprised in the second
and third articles should have general pardon for all
“attainders, outlawries, treasons (?), misprisions of treasons,
præmunires, felonies, trespasses, and other crimes
and misdemeanors whatsoever, committed by them, or any
of them since the beginning of the reign of James II; and
if any of them are attainted by Parliament, the Lords Justices
and the General will use their best endeavors to get
the same repealed by Parliament, and the outlawries to be
reversed gratis, all but writing-clerk’s fees.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Article VI provided general immunity to both parties for
debts or disturbances arising out of the late war. This
provision applied also to rates and rents.</p>

<p class='c009'>Article VII provided that “every nobleman and gentleman
comprised in the second and third articles shall have
liberty to ride with a sword and case of pistols, if they
[<i>sic</i>] think fit, and keep a gun in their houses for the defence
of the same, or for fowling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The eighth article granted leave to the inhabitants, or
residents, of Limerick, and other Irish garrisons, to remove
their goods and chattels, if so disposed, without interference,
search, or the payment of duties, and they were
privileged to remain in their lodgings for six weeks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tenth article declared that “no person, or persons,
who shall at any time hereafter break these articles, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>any of them, shall thereby make or cause any other person
or persons to forfeit or lose the benefit of the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Article XII read thus: “The Lords Justices and the General
do undertake that their Majesties will ratify these articles
within the space of three months, or sooner, and use
their utmost endeavors that the same shall be ratified and
confirmed in the Parliament.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The thirteenth, and final, article made provision for the
protection from financial loss of Colonel John Browne,
commissary-general of the Irish army, who, during the
war, had seized the property of certain Williamites for the
public use, charging the debt, pro rata, on the Catholic
estates secured to their owners under the treaty; and requiring
General (Lord Lucan) to certify the account with
Colonel Browne within 21 days.</p>

<p class='c009'>It will be remembered, in examining the religious provisions
of the Treaty of Limerick, that Catholic worship
in the reign of Charles II was permitted by connivance
rather than by law. Many of the worst of the penal laws,
although in abeyance, might be revived at any time by law
officers tyrannically disposed toward the Catholics. The
latter were once again to discover that it is one thing to
obtain a favorable treaty from a formidable enemy, while
they have arms in their hands and a still inviolate fortress
at their backs, but quite a different matter to make the foe
live up to the provisions of the treaty when the favorable
conditions for the capitulators have passed away. But of
this hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not many days subsequent to the surrender of Limerick,
Count Chateau-Renaud, with a powerful French fleet, having
on board arms, cannon, and all kinds of military supplies,
together with a veteran contingent of 3,000 men and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>200 officers, cast anchor in Dingle Bay, on the southern
coast, without once coming in contact with the naval might
of England. Were the Irish a dishonorable people, they
could have then, with great advantage, repudiated the
treaty, but the national honor was irrevocably plighted,
and, consequently, there was an end of the struggle. Many
honest Irish writers have blamed the precipitancy of Sarsfield
and the other leaders in signing the articles of capitulation,
and not without good cause. Lord Lucan should
have court-martialed and shot the leaders of the peace-at-any-price
traitors when they first showed their hands.
Hugh O’Neill, Red Hugh O’Donnell, or Owen Roe O’Neill
would have done so without hesitation, but, then, Sarsfield
was only half a Celt, and had an unfortunate tenderness
for his fellows of the Pale. It is regrettable that none of
the French generals has left a clear statement of the events
that led to the premature surrender of the town; but we
know that King Louis, who subsequently honored Sarsfield,
held D’Usson responsible, for Story tells us, on page
280 of his “Continuation of the History of the Wars in
Ireland,” that “the French king [Louis XIV] was so far
from thanking him for it [the capitulation] that, after
some public indignities, he sent him to the Bastile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Viewed in the light of after events, the Treaty of Limerick,
from the Irish standpoint, looks like a huge game
of confidence, and is an ineradicable blot on English military
and diplomatic honor. The civil articles were ignored,
or trampled under foot, almost immediately. The military
articles were better observed, except that provision which
related to transportation to France, which was grossly violated
and led to the drowning in Cork Harbor of a number
of the wives of the Irish soldiery, who, unable to find room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>on board, owing to De Ginkel’s alleged faithlessness, or
the perfidy of his lieutenants, clung to the ropes, when the
ships set sail, and were dragged beneath the waves to their
death.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mitchel, in his able “History of Ireland,” page 3, writing
of this painful incident, defends Sarsfield against an
imputation cast upon that officer by Lord Macaulay, in his
brilliant but unreliable “History of England,” thus: “As to
General Sarsfield’s proclamation to the men ‘that they should
be permitted to carry their wives and families to France,’
he made the statement on the faith of the First and several
succeeding articles of the treaty, not yet being aware of any
design to violate it. But this is not all: The historian who
could not let the hero go into his sorrowful exile without
seeking to plunge his venomous sting into his reputation,
had before him the ‘Life of King William,’ by Harris, and
also Curry’s ‘Historical Review of the Civil Wars,’ wherein
he must have seen that the Lords Justices and General
Ginkel are charged with endeavoring to defeat the execution
of the First Article. For, says Harris, ‘as great numbers
of the officers and soldiers had resolved to enter into
the service of France, and to carry their families with them,
Ginkel would not suffer their wives and children to be
shipped off with the men, not doubting that by detaining the
former he would have prevented many of the latter from
going into that service. This, I say, was confessedly an
infringement of the articles.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“To this we may add,” continues Mitchel, “that no Irish
officer or soldier in France attributed the cruel parting at
Cork to any fault of Sarsfield, but always and only to a
breach of the Treaty of Limerick. And if he had deluded
them in the manner represented by the English historian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>they would not have followed him as enthusiastically [as
they afterward did] on the fields of Steinkirk and Landen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Mitchel did Lord Macaulay an unintentional injustice
in attributing the original charge against Sarsfield to
him. It originated with Chaplain Story, and can be found
on pages 291-293 of his Continuation, in these words:
“Those [of the Irish] who were now embarking had not
much better usage on this side of the water [he had alluded
to the alleged ill-treatment of the first contingent on its arrival
in France], for a great many of them, having wives and
children, they made what shift they could to desert, rather
than leave their families behind to starve, which my Lord
Lucan and Major-General Wauchop perceiving, they publish
a declaration that as many of the Irish as had a mind
to’t should have liberty to transport their families along
with themselves. And, accordingly, a vast rabble of all
sorts were brought to the water-side, when the major-general
[Wauchop], pretending to ship the soldiers in order,
according to their lists, they first carried all the men on
board; and many of the women, at the second return of
the boats for the officers, catching hold to be carried on
board, were dragged off, and, through fearfulness, losing
their hold, were drowned; but others who held faster had
their fingers cut off, and so perished in sight of their husbands
or relatives, tho’ those of them that did get over [to
France], would make but a sad figure, if they were admitted
to go to the late queen’s court at St. Germain.... Lord
Lucan finding he had ships enough for all the Irish
that were likely to go with him, the number that went before
and these shipped at this time, being, according to the
best computation, 12,000 of all sorts [a palpable underestimate],
he signs the following releasement:</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>“‘Whereas, by the Articles of Limerick, Lieutenant-General
Ginkel, commander-in-chief of the English army, did
engage himself to furnish 10,000 tons of shipping for the
transporting of such of the Irish forces to France as were
willing to go thither; and to facilitate their passage to add
4,000 tons more in case the French fleet did not come to
this kingdom to take off some of these forces; and whereas
the French fleet has been upon the coast and carried away
some of the said forces, and the lieutenant-general has provided
ships for as many of the rest as are willing to go as
aforesaid, I do hereby declare that the said lieutenant-general
is released from any obligation he lay under from the
said articles, to provide vessels for that purpose, and do
quit and renounce all farther claim and pretension on this
account, etc. Witness my hand this 8th day of December,
1691.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>From the same authority we learn that “on December 22,
my Lord Lucan, and the rest of the Irish great officers,
went on board the transport ships [bound for France], leaving
hostages at Cork for the return of the said ships.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It is impossible to reconcile the circumstantial statement
of the Williamite historian, Harris, in regard to Ginkel’s
faithlessness, with the official document, signed by Sarsfield,
as Earl of Lucan, which practically exonerates the Dutch
general. Would Sarsfield have signed such a release if
Ginkel had been guilty of the treachery ascribed to him by
Harris? Story’s book was published a year before Lord
Lucan fell in Flanders, and must have been read by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>general and the officers who served with him at Limerick.
One thing about the question is certain—if Sarsfield ever issued
the proclamation, in conjunction with General Wauchop,
ascribed to him by the English chaplain, he must have
been grossly deceived by somebody. All writers of his own
times, and of after times, describe Sarsfield as the soul of
honor, but some have asserted that he was rather easy-going
in business affairs, and a little too ready to sign any document
placed before him.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have been unable to find any contemporary confirmation
of the romantic Irish tradition that the Treaty of Limerick
was signed on the historic bowlder, now preserved by
pedestal and railing near Thomond Bridge, on the Clare
bank of the Shannon. But tradition is often more accurate
than written history. Therefore, the Irish people having
accepted the story through more than six generations, we
accept with them the legend of “the Treaty Stone.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>IMMEDIATELY after the signing of the treaty, it was
fixed upon between De Ginkel and Sarsfield that, on October
6, the Irish infantry would march out of the King’s
Island by Thomond Bridge, into the County Clare, and there
and then make a choice of service with England or France.
It was arranged that those who chose the former service
were to turn to the left at a certain point, where an English
flag was planted, while those who decided for France were
to march straight onward to a more distant point marked
by the French standard. They were, in all, about 15,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>men, and, quite naturally, the respective leaders awaited the
result with burning anxiety. They were not left long
in doubt. The first body to march was the Royal Irish
regiment of Foot Guards, fourteen hundred strong, of which
Mr. Story remarks wofully, it “seemed to go all entire
[for France] except seven men, which the general was
much concerned at, then my Lord Iveagh’s regiment of
Ulster Irish came off entire to our side.” In all a little over
1,000 officers and men ranged themselves under the flag of
King William, while nearly 13,000 mustered under the
Fleur-de-Lis. A few days afterward, the Irish horse, now
much reduced, made choice in the same fashion, and with
about the same proportionate result. The same privilege
was granted the outlying bodies of King James’s army, and
all decided for France in the proportion of about ten to one.
Of the Irish general officers, more or less under the suspicion
of the army since the disasters of Aughrim and
Annaghbeg, we find Generals Luttrell and Clifford, Baron
Purcell, “and a great many more of the Irish nobility and
gentry going toward Dublin,” which means that they made
terms with the enemy.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was well along in the month of December before the
Irish soldiers who had volunteered to go beyond the seas
were entirely transported to France. The foot, for the most
part, sailed from Limerick, many of them in the returning
fleet of Chateau-Renaud, and the cavalry from Cork, where
occurred the tragical event we have already related. In all—including
the capitulated troops from every Irish garrison—20,000
men from Ireland landed in the French ports,
and these, together with Mountcashel’s Brigade, which had
been in the French service since before the battle of the
Boyne, made up a force of 25,000 veterans, who were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>mostly in the pay of King Louis, but all of whom were
sworn to support King James in any effort he might put
forth to recover his crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>As much injustice has been done the memory of King
James II by Irish writers, who have taken too much for
granted on traditional “hearsay,” we deem it only fair to
place before the readers of this history the sentiments of
the unfortunate monarch toward his Irish defenders. We
quote from his Memoirs, Vol. II, pp. 465-467: “Thus was
Ireland [he alluded to the fall of Limerick], after an obstinate
resistance in three years’ campaigns, by the power and
riches of England, and the revolt of almost all its [Ireland’s]
own Protestant subjects torn from its natural sovereign,
who, tho’ he was divested of the country, was not wholly
deprived of the people, for the greatest part of those who
were then in arms for the defence of his right, not content
with the service already rendered, got leave [as was said]
to come and lose their lives, after having lost their estates,
in defence of his title, and brought by that means such a body
of men into France as by their generous comportment in accepting
the pay of the country [much less than British or
Irish pay] instead of that which is usually allowed there
[in France] to strangers and their inimitable valor and service
during the whole course of the war, might justly make
their prince pass for an ally, rather than a pensioner, or
burden, to his Most Christian Majesty, whose pay, indeed,
they received, but acted by the king’s, their master’s, commission,
according to the common method of other auxiliary
troops. As soon as the king [James] heard of their arrival
[in France] he writ to the commander [General Sheldon,
who went with the first contingent] to assure him how
well he was satisfied with the behavior and conduct of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>officers, and the valor and fidelity of the soldiers, and how
sensible he should ever be of their service, which he would
not fail to reward when it should please God to put him
in a capacity of doing it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Following is the full text of the letter addressed to the
Irish troops through their general by King James, as given
in Story’s Continuation, page 289:</p>

<p class='c024'>“<span class='sc'>James Rex</span>.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Having been informed of the capitulation and surrender
of Limerick, and the other places which remained to
us in our Kingdom of Ireland, and of the necessities which
forced the Lords Justices and general officers of our forces
thereunto: we will not defer to let you know, and the rest
of the officers that came along with you, that we are extremely
satisfied with your and their conduct, and of the
valor of the soldiers during the siege, but most particularly
of your and their declaration and resolution to come and
serve where we are. And we assure you, and order you
to assure both officers and soldiers that are come along with
you, that we shall never forget this act of loyalty, nor fail,
when in a capacity to give them, above others, particular
marks of our favor. In the meantime, you are to inform
them that they are to serve under our command, and by
our commissions; and if we find that a considerable number
[of them] is come with the fleet, it will induce us to
go personally to see them, and regiment them: Our brother,
the King of France, hath already given orders to clothe
them and furnish them with all necessaries, and to give
them quarters of refreshment. So we bid you heartily
farewell.</p>

<p class='c027'>“Given at our Court at St. Germain the 27th of November [Dec. 7], 1691.”</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>In pursuance of his promise, King James made two
fatiguing trips from St. Germain to Bretagne and return,
regimented the gallant exiles at Vannes, Brest, and other
points, and in every possible way showed his marked appreciation
of their devotion. He was accompanied by his
son, the Duke of Berwick.</p>

<p class='c009'>In accepting French pay, the Irish soldiery exposed themselves
almost to penury, and their officers submitted to be
reduced in rank, almost without a murmur. Major-generals
became colonels; colonels, captains; captains, lieutenants,
and many of the latter sergeants. This was absolutely
necessary, as there was room for only a certain number
in the French establishment. Many reduced officers
served also as volunteers, without pay of any kind, waiting
patiently for death or promotion. The total amount of
property sacrificed by these brave men in the Jacobite cause
was 1,060,792 acres, and this new confiscation placed fully
seven-eighths of the soil of Ireland in the hands of the supporters
of the English interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>William and Mary formally ratified the Articles of the
Treaty of Limerick within the specified three months, but
the English Parliament, influenced by motives of greed and
bigotry, shamefully refused to acquiesce, and as William
and Mary did not endanger their crown by offering a
vigorous opposition, the civil articles of Limerick were, from
that moment, a dead letter. Then redescended on Ireland
“the long, black night of the penal laws,” and we gladly
turn from it, for a period, to follow the brilliant but bloody
fortunes of the Irish Brigade in the service of France.</p>

    <div>Early Exploits of the Irish Brigade in the Service of France—At Landen, Cremona, and Blenheim—Tribute Paid it by an English Historian</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>IN the preceding chapter we indicated that we would deal
with the history of the Irish brigades in the French
service, from 1692 to 1792, before touching on the terrible
penal period in Ireland. Their services have won a
fame so world-wide that no history of Europe is complete
that omits them from its pages. They were prominently
engaged in the reign of Louis XIV in the War of the
League of Augsburg, which was hotly waged by nearly
all Europe against him, from 1688 to the Peace of Ryswick,
in 1697; in the War of the Spanish Succession—waged
by Louis to support his grandson, Philip of Anjou, on the
Spanish throne—commenced in 1700 and concluded by the
Peace of Utrecht and Treaty of Rastadt in 1713-14, and
under Louis XV in numerous minor wars with Germany,
and especially in the War of the Austrian Succession—France
supporting the claim of Charles VII, of Bavaria,
against Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary, daughter of
the last Hapsburg Emperor of Germany, Charles VI.
This war was begun in 1740. France took sides in 1743,
and it was concluded by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in
1748. In each of these contests France and England were
on opposite sides—a circumstance favorable to the bloody
development of Irish hatred. After the last of the wars
specified, the Irish Brigade, having no warlike food on
which to flourish, covered with laurels and “worn out with
glory,” faded from the fields of Europe.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>In another place we have alluded to the campaign of
Savoy, 1690-91, in which the ill-starred St. Ruth was chief
in command. Mountcashel’s, known as the “Old Brigade,”
scaled every Alpine fortress, drove the vengeful “Vaudois”
from their rugged hills, and laid the country under fire and
sword, leaving a reputation for military prowess fresh, at
this day, amid the mountains of Savoy.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Flanders, in 1692, under Sarsfield and Lord Clare,
the “New” Brigade won great honor at Steinkirk, where
Luxemburg routed King William. At Landen, or Neerwinden,
in July, 1693, William held his ground desperately
against the bravest efforts of the French. Luxemburg
was in despair, when the fierce war-cry, “Remember Limerick!”
rent the clouds, and the Royal Irish Foot Guards,
led by Colonel John Barrett, shattered the English centre,
broke into Neerwinden, opened a path to victory for the
French Household, and William was hurled into the river
Gette, while the Irish shout of victory shook the plain like
a clap of thunder. Sarsfield, like the brave Barrett, received
his death wound, but his dying gaze beheld the
sight he most loved to see—the English flag in sullen
flight.</p>

<p class='c009'>This same year, in Italy, under Catinat, the “Old” Brigade
made its mark at Marsaglia, where it defeated
the Savoyard centre, drew the whole French army after
it, and chased Victor Amadeus almost to the gates of
Turin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thenceforth, Lord Mountcashel having died of his
wounds, the two brigades were united as one. The
younger Schomberg, son of the hero of the Boyne, fell
before the Irish bayonets at Marsaglia. At the battle of
Montgry, in Spain, fought in 1694, by the French against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>the Spanish, the “Brigade,” under Marshal de Noailles,
renewed its laurels, and the Irish charge proved potent in
bringing the Spaniards to terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>This war terminated gloriously for France by the Peace
of Ryswick.</p>

<p class='c009'>The War of the Spanish Succession broke out in 1700.
England and Austria supported the Archduke Charles
against Philip of Anjou, the Bourbon heir. This struggle
brought upon the stage the Duke of Marlborough, for England,
and Prince Eugene, of Savoy, for Austria, two of
the greatest generals of modern times. Marshals, the Duke
of Berwick, Catinat, Villeroy, Vendome, Villairs, Boufflers,
and Noailles, commanded the armies of France. In this
frightful struggle, the Irish flag always blazed in the vanguard
of victory, in the rearguard of defeat, and the Irish
name became the synonym of valor.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the winter of 1702, the citadel of Cremona, in northern
Italy, was held for France by Marshal Villeroy, with a
strong garrison. The French gave themselves up to revelry,
and the walls were poorly guarded. Caissioli, an Italian,
informed Prince Eugene, the Austrian commander, of the
state of affairs. The traitor agreed to let in a portion of
the enemy by means of a sewer running from outside the
walls under his house. At the same time the French sentinels
at the gate of St. Margaret, badly defended, were to
be drawn off, so that Eugene himself, with a strong body
of cuirassiers, might enter and join the other party. Count
Merci was to attack the “Gate of the Po,” defended by an
Irish company, and Prince Vaudemont and Count Freiberg
were to support the attack with the cavalry of their respective
commands. The attack was made at midnight, and the
plans were admirably executed. The Austrians were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>possession of the town before the garrison was alarmed.
Count Merci, however, met bad fortune at the “Gate of
the Po.” The Irish guard, chatting over old times by the
Shannon, the Barrow, or the Suir, kept faithful watch. The
clatter of hoofs aroused them, as Merci, attended by several
regiments of dragoons, rode up to the gate and called upon
them to surrender. The Irish replied with a sharp volley,
which laid some of the Austrians out in the roadway. The
fire aroused the sleeping Irish regiments of Dillon and
Burke, who, in their shirts only, as they sprang from
bivouac, grasped their muskets and hastened to the rescue.
They were met in the square by Eugene’s cuirassiers, who
charged them fiercely. Major O’Mahoney formed his Irish
into a square and let the Austrians have a fusillade. The
cuirassiers, urged by Eugene and Freiberg, dashed madly
at the Irish battalions, but, despite the bravest efforts of this
iron cavalry, the Irish actually routed them and slew their
leader, Baron Freiberg. Marshal Villeroy was made prisoner
by Macdonald, an Irishman in the Austrian service,
and the French general second in command shared the same
fate. But the Irish still held out, fighting desperately and
losing half their men. This prolonged resistance alarmed
the French, who now, thoroughly aroused, gallantly seconded
their Irish comrades, and, after a terrible carnage of
eight hours’ duration, Prince Eugene, with all that remained
of the flower of the Austrian cavalry, gave up in despair, and
was hurled pell-mell through the gates of St. Margaret, by
the victorious garrison. This exploit of the Irish saved
northern Italy to the French monarch—the Austrians retreated
to the Alps. All Europe rang applause. Louis
raised the pay of his Irish troops, and made O’Mahoney
a general. He also decreed that Irishmen, who deserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>the honor, should thenceforth be recognized as French citizens,
without undergoing the form of naturalization.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the first battle of Blenheim, Bavaria, in 1703, the
Irish, under Marshal Tallard, contributed to that victory.
The regiment of Clare, encountering the Austrian guards,
was, for a moment, overpowered, but, immediately rallying,
it counter-charged with such fury that it not alone recovered
its own flag, but gained two colors from the enemy!</p>

<p class='c009'>The second Blenheim, so disastrous to France, was fought
in 1704. Marlborough commanded the English right, facing
Marshal Tallard, and Eugene commanded the allied left,
facing Marshal de Marcin, with whom was the Irish Brigade.
Tallard was dreadfully beaten, and Marcin fared little better.
The French suffered great slaughter, and were badly
worsted. The Brigade, however, would not lose heart.
Closing up its ranks, it made a superb charge on Prince
Eugene’s lines, broke through them—being one of the few
corps in the French army that saved their colors that day—and
covered the retreat of France to the Rhine!</p>

<p class='c009'>The English professor, E. S. Creasy of Cambridge University,
writing of the conduct of the Irish in this great battle,
says, on page 318 of his “Fifteen Decisive Battles of the
World”: “The [French] centre was composed of fourteen
battalions of infantry, including the celebrated Irish Brigade.
These were posted in the little hamlet of Oberglau,
which lies somewhat nearer to Lutzingen than to Blenheim.”
And, on page 320 of the same work, the professor continues:
“The Prince of Holstein Beck had, with eleven Hanoverian
battalions, passed the Nebel opposite to Oberglau when he
was charged and utterly routed by the Irish Brigade, which
held that village. The Irish drove the Hanoverians back
with heavy slaughter, broke completely through the line of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>the allies, and nearly achieved a success as brilliant as that
which the same Brigade afterward gained at Fontenoy. But
at Blenheim their ardor in pursuit led them too far. Marlborough
came up in person and dashed in on the exposed
flank of the Brigade with some squadrons of British cavalry.
The Irish reeled back, and, as they strove to regain the
heights of Oberglau, their column was raked through and
through by the fire of three battalions of the allies, which
Marlborough had summoned up from the reserve.” Competent
military critics have observed that had the French
cavalry seconded the charge of the Irish infantry, Blenheim
would have been a French victory.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>IN the summer of 1705, the Irish again, at the battle of
Cassano, where they fought under Marshal Vendome,
paid their respects to Prince Eugene. They fought with a
bravery that electrified the French and paralyzed the Austrians.
Vendome’s flank was badly annoyed by a hostile battery
on the farther bank of the river Adda. The stream was
broad and deep, but two Irish regiments, under cover of
the smoke, swam across it, and, under the very nose of the
great Eugene, captured the Austrian cannon and turned
their fire upon the enemy! This intrepid action decided
the day, and France was once more triumphant, by her
Irish arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Conspicuous in this brilliant action, as also at Cremona,
was the famous “Regiment of Burke”—the last to yield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>at Aughrim. Of it the Scotch-Canadian poet and novelist,
William McLennan, has written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Would you read your name on honor’s roll?</div>

      <div class='line in1'>But to-night we toast the morn that broke and wakened us to fame—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The day we beat Prince Eugene in Cremona!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Marshal Villeroy, in May, 1706, allowed himself to be
cooped up by the Duke of Marlborough in the village of
Ramillies, in Flanders. The French were utterly overwhelmed,
and many thousands of prisoners were taken.
Lord Clare formed the Brigade into a column of attack and
broke through the victorious enemy. The regiment of
Clare, in this charge, met the English regiment of Churchill—now
the Third Buffs—full tilt, crushed it hopelessly, captured
its battle-flags, and served a Scotch regiment, in the
Dutch service, which endeavored to support the British, in
the same manner. The Brigade then effected its retreat on
Ypres, where, in the convent of the Benedictine nuns, it
hung up the captured colors—“sole trophies of Ramillies’
fray”—where they have waved, for many a generation,
a fitting memento of the faith and fame of the Irish exiles.</p>

<p class='c009'>In April, 1707, the Brigade next distinguished itself, at the
battle of Almanza, in Spain, where it fought in the army of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Marshal the Duke of Berwick. The English and Austrians
were commanded by Ruvigny—the Williamite Earl of Galway—who
signalized himself at Aughrim. The Brigade
paid him back that day. It charged with a fury never excelled
in any fight. The allies were overthrown, Ruvigny
disgraced, and the crown of Spain was placed on the brow
of Philip V.</p>

<p class='c009'>In defeat, as in victory, the bayonets of the Brigade
still opened up the road to honor. When the French retreated
from Oudenarde, in July, 1708, Marlborough felt the
Irish steel, as the gallant fellows hung doggedly behind the
retiring French, kept the fierce pursuers at bay, and enabled
Vendome to reorganize his beaten army. The battle of
Malplaquet, fought September, 1709, was the bloodiest of
this most sanguinary war. The French fought with unusual
desperation, and the English ranks, led by Marlborough and
seconded by Eugene, were decimated. It was an unmitigated
slaughter. At length Marshal Villairs, who commanded
the French, was wounded and Marshal Boufflers
ordered a retreat. Again the Irish Brigade, which fought
with its usual courage all through that dreadful day, had
the honor of forming the French rearguard, and, although
many flags, captured from France, were laid at the feet of
the victor, no Irish color graced the trophies of Marlborough,
who, with the ill-judged battle of Malplaquet, virtually
ended his grand career as a soldier. After that fight
the war was feebly waged—France being completely exhausted—until
the Peace of Utrecht and Treaty of Rastadt,
1713-14, closed the bloody record.</p>

<p class='c009'>It would be almost impossible to enumerate the sieges
and minor actions in which the Irish Brigade of France participated
within the limits of this history. The facts we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>have given, and are to give, rest on the authority of the
French war records, and the testimony of English and other
writers, carefully compiled by Matthew O’Conor, in his
“Military History of the Irish People,” and by John C.
O’Callaghan in his invaluable “History of the Irish Brigades”—works
which should ensure for their able and careful
authors a literary immortality, and which people of the
Irish race should treasure among their most precious heirlooms.
It would be equally difficult to follow the career of
those Irish soldiers who, at the peace, transferred their
swords from France to Spain, because Louis XV, who succeeded
his grandfather while yet a child, could not employ
them all. In Spain, as in France, their swords were sharpest
where the English were their foes, always, it must be
admitted, worthy of their steel.</p>

<p class='c009'>The subjoined statement of the strength of the Irish forces
in the French service during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries is taken from the authorities already quoted:</p>

<p class='c009'>From 1690 to 1692, three regiments of foot; 1692 to 1698,
thirteen regiments of infantry, three independent companies,
two companies of cavalry, and two troops of horse guards;
1698 to 1714, eight regiments of infantry and one regiment
of horse; 1714 to 1744, five regiments of infantry and one
of cavalry; 1744 to 1762, six regiments of infantry and
one of horse; 1762 to 1775, five regiments of infantry; 1775
to 1791—the period of the dissolution of the Brigade—three
regiments of foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the fall of Limerick, in 1691, to the French Revolution,
according to the most reliable estimate, there fell in
the field for France, or otherwise died in her service,
480,000 Irish soldiers. The Brigade was kept recruited by
military emigrants, borne from Ireland—chiefly from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>province of Munster—by French smugglers, under the romantic
and significant title of “Wild Geese”—in poetical allusion
to their eastward flight. By this name the Brigade
is best remembered among the Irish peasantry.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the death of Louis XIV, the Irish Brigade had comparatively
little wholesale fighting to keep them occupied,
until the War of the Austrian Succession, thirty years later.
They made many expeditions to the smaller states on the
Rhenish frontier, with which France was in a chronic state
of war, under the Duke of Berwick. In every combat they
served with honor, and always appeared to best advantage
where the hail of death fell thickest. At times, like most
of their countrymen, they were inclined to wildness, but the
first drum-roll or bugle blast found them ready for the fray.
On the march to attack Fort Kehl, in 1733, Marshal Berwick—who
was killed two years afterward at the siege
of Philipsburg—found fault with Dillon’s regiment for some
breach of discipline while en route. He sent the colonel
with despatches to Louis XV, and, among other matters,
in a paternal way—for Berwick loved his Irishmen—called
the king’s attention to the indiscreet battalion. The monarch,
on reading the document, turned to the Irish officer,
and, in the hearing of the whole court, petulantly exclaimed:
“My Irish troops cause me more uneasiness than
all the rest of my armies!” “Sire,” immediately rejoined
the noble Count Dillon—subsequently killed at Fontenoy—“all
your Majesty’s enemies make precisely the same complaint.”
Louis, pleased with the repartee, smiled, and,
like a true Frenchman, wiped out his previous unkindness
by complimenting the courage of the Brigade.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great War of the Austrian Succession inaugurated
the fateful campaigns of 1743 and 1745, respectively signalized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>by the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy. The former
was a day of dark disaster to France, and Fontenoy was a
mortal blow to British arrogance.</p>

<p class='c009'>At Dettingen the Earl of Stair commanded the English
and Hanoverians, although George II and his son, Cumberland,
were present on the field. Marshal de Noailles commanded
the French, and was badly worsted, after a desperate
engagement. The Irish Brigade, summoned from a long
distance, arrived too late to restore the battle, and met the
French army in full retreat, hotly pursued by the allies.
The Brigade, under the orders of Lord Clare, opened their
ranks and allowed the French to retire, and then, closing
steadily up, they uttered their charging cry, and, with leveled
bayonet, checked the fierce pursuers. Thus, once again,
the Irish Brigade formed the French rearguard, as the
Fleur-de-Lis retired from the plains of Germany.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE famous battle of Fontenoy was fought on the soil
of Belgium, in the ancient province of Hainault, within
some thirty miles of the memorable plains of Waterloo, on
May 11, new style, 1745. France, as we have already
noted, championed the cause of Charles of Bavaria, who
laid claim to the Austrian throne, while England, Holland,
Hanover, and Austria took the side of Maria Theresa, who
eventually, owing to the unexpected death of Charles, won
the fiercely disputed crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>The French were besieging Tournay with 18,000 men.
A corps of 6,000 guarded the bridges over the Scheldt, on
the northern bank of which Marshal Saxe, accompanied by
Louis XV and the Dauphin, having with him 45,000 men,
including the Irish Brigade, took post, to cover the siege of
Tournay, and prevent the march of the allies, English,
Dutch, and Germans, under the Duke of Cumberland and
Prince Waldeck, to its relief. The duke was a brave soldier,
but fierce and cruel as a tiger. History knows him by
the well-won title of “the butcher Cumberland.” His business
was to raise the siege of Tournay and open a road to
Paris. He had under his command 55,000 veteran troops,
including the English Household regiments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The French lines extended from the village of Rhamecroix,
behind De Barri’s Wood, on the left, to the village
of Fontenoy, in the centre, and from the latter position to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>the intrenchments of Antoine, on the right. This line of
defence was admirably guarded by “fort and flanking battery.”
The Irish Brigade—composed that day of the infantry
regiments of Clare, Dillon, Bulkeley, Roth, Berwick,
and Lally—Fitz-James’s horse being with the French
cavalry in advance—was stationed, in reserve, near the
wood, supported by the brigades of Normandie and De Vassieux.</p>

<p class='c009'>Prince Waldeck commanded the allied left, in front of
Antoine. Brigadier Ingoldsby commanded the British
right, facing the French redoubt at De Barri’s Wood, while
Cumberland, chief in command, was with the allied centre,
confronting Fontenoy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The battle opened with a furious cannonade, at 5 o’clock
in the morning. After some hours spent in this manner,
Ingoldsby attempted to carry the redoubt, but was ignominiously
repulsed, and could not be induced to renew the
attempt. This refusal subsequently led to his dismissal
from the army on a charge of cowardice. Prince Waldeck
fared no better at Antoine, being defeated in two attempts
to force the lines. The Duke of Cumberland, grown impatient
because of repeated failures, loaded the unfortunate
commanding officers with imprecations. He took the resolve
of beating the French at any cost by a concentrated
attack on their left centre, through a gap of about 700
yards, which occurred between the Fontenoy redoubts and
the work vainly attacked by Ingoldsby in the edge of the
wood of Barri. For this purpose, he formed his reserves
and least battered active battalions, including the English
guards, several British line regiments, and a large body of
picked Hanoverian troops, into three columns, aggregating
16,000 men, preceded and flanked by twenty pieces of cannon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>all drawn by hand, to avoid the confusion incident on
the killing and wounding of the battery horses. But subsequent
developments compelled the Duke to change the original
formation to one massive, solid oblong wedge, the British
on the right and the Hanoverians on the left. Lord
Charles Hay, the boldest soldier in the allied army, drew his
sword and led the attacking column. Meanwhile, Cumberland
renewed the attack all along the line, in order to cover
the advance of his human battering-ram. Thus, the French
were pressed hard at every point, but their batteries and battalions
replied with spirit, and Antoine held out heroically
in spite of all the efforts of Waldeck and his Dutch and
Austrian troops against it. These latter were badly cut up
by the fire of a French battery planted beyond the Scheldt.
Up to this period, about the noon hour, everything had gone
favorably for the French.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the decisive moment had now arrived, and the great
Anglo-Hanoverian column received the command—“Forward,
march!” “In front of them, as it chanced,” says
Mitchel, “were four battalions of the French guards,
with two battalions of Swiss on their left and two other
French regiments on their right. The French officers
seem to have been greatly surprised when they saw the
English battery taking up position on the summit of the
rising ground. ‘English cannon!’ they cried. ‘Let us
go and take them!’ They mounted the slope with their
grenadiers, but were astonished to find an army on their
front. A heavy discharge, both of artillery and musketry,
made them quickly recoil with heavy loss.” On, then,
swept the English column, with free and gallant stride, between
Fontenoy and De Barri’s wood, whose batteries
plowed them from flank to flank at every step. But in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>teeth of the artillery, the musketry and the bombshells
which rose, circled and fell among them, killing and wounding
scores at each explosion; charged by the cavalry of the
royal household, and exposed to the iron hail of the French
sharpshooters, that blue-and-scarlet wave of battle rolled
proudly against the serried ranks of France. Falling by
the hundred, they finally got beyond the cross-fire from the
redoubts, crossed the slope and penetrated behind the village
of Fontenoy—marching straight on the headquarters
of the king! The column was quickly in the middle of the
picked soldiers of France, tossing them haughtily aside
with the ready bayonet, while the cheers of anticipated victory
resounded from their ranks far over the bloody field.
Marshal Saxe, ill, and pale with rage and vexation, sprang,
unarmored, upon his horse, and seemed to think the battle
lost, for he ordered the evacuation of Antoine, in order that
the bridges across the Scheldt might be covered and the
king’s escape assured. At this moment, Count Lally, of
the Irish Brigade, rode up to Duke Richelieu, Saxe’s chief
aide, and said to him: “We have still four field-pieces in
reserve—they should batter the head of that column. The
Irish Brigade has not yet been engaged. Order it to fall
on the English flank. Let the whole army second it—let
us fall on the English like foragers!” Richelieu, who, afterward,
allowed the suggestion to appear as if coming from
himself, went at once to Saxe and gave him the substance
of Lally’s proposal. The king and Dauphin, who were present,
approved of it. The order to evacuate Antoine was
countermanded, and aides immediately galloped to the rear
of the wood of Barri to order up the Irish Brigade, commanded
by Lord Clare, and its supporting regiments. These
brave men, rendered excited and impatient by the noise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>the battle, in which they had not yet been allowed to participate,
received the command with loud demonstrations of
joy. Their officers immediately led them toward the point
of danger.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile, the English column, marching and firing
steadily—that “infernal, rolling fire,” so characteristic of
the British mode of fighting—kept on its terrible course, and
crushed every French organization that stood in its path.
Had the Dutch and Austrians succeeded in carrying Antoine
at this moment, Cumberland must have been victorious and
the French army could not have escaped. Already the column,
still bleeding at every stride, was within sight of the
royal tent. The English officers actually laid their canes
along the barrels of the muskets to make the men fire low.
Suddenly, the fire from the four reserve French cannon
opened on the head of the column, and the foremost files
went down. The English guns replied stoutly and the
march was renewed. But now there came an ominous
sound from the side of De Barri’s wood that made Lord
Hay, brave and bold as he was, start, pause, and listen. It
swelled above the crash of artillery and the continuous rattle
of musketry. “Nearer, clearer, deadlier than before,” that
fierce hurrah bursts upon the ear of battle! The English
have heard that shout before and remember it to their cost.
The crisis of the conflict has come, and the command, by
voice and bugle, “Halt! halt!” rang from front to rear of the
bleeding column. The ranks were dressed hastily, and the
English prepared to meet the advancing enemy with a
deadly volley from their front and long right flank. They
looked anxiously in the direction of the wood and beheld
long lines and bristling columns of men in blue and red—the
uniform of the Irish Brigade—coming on at the charging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>step, with colors flying and “the generals and colonels
on horseback among the glittering bayonets.” They did
not fire a single shot as they came on. Behind them were
masses of men in blue and white. These were the French
supports. Again the British officers laid their canes
across the barrels of the muskets, and, as the Brigade
came within close range, a murderous volley
rolled out. Hundreds of the Irish fell, but the survivors,
leaping over the dead, dying, and wounded, never paused for
a moment. They closed the wide gaps in their ranks and
advanced at a run until they came within bayonet thrust or
butt-stroke of the front and right of the English column,
which they immediately crushed out of military shape; while
their fierce war-shout, uttered in the Irish tongue—“Revenge!
Remember Limerick and English treachery!”
sounded the death-knell of Cumberland’s heroic soldiers.
While the clubbed muskets of the Brigade beat down the English
ranks, that furious war-cry rang even unto the walls
of old Tournay. The French regiments of Normandie and
Vassieux bravely seconded the Irish charge, and they and
other Gallic troops disposed of the Hanoverians. Within
ten minutes from the time when the Brigade came in contact
with the English column, no British soldiers, except the
dead, wounded, and captured, remained on the slope of Fontenoy.
Bulkeley’s Irish regiment nearly annihilated the
Coldstream Guards and captured their colors.</p>

<p class='c009'>This victory saved France from invasion, but it cost the
Irish dear. Count Dillon was slain, Lord Clare disabled,
while one-third of the officers and one-fourth of the men
were killed or wounded. King Louis, next morning, publicly
thanked the Irish, made Lally a general, and Lord Clare
was, soon afterward, created a marshal of France. England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>met retribution for her cruelty and faithlessness to Ireland,
and King George vehemently cursed the laws which
drove the Irish exiles to win glory and vengeance on that
bloody day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The losses in the battle were nearly equal—the French,
Swiss, and Irish losing altogether 7,139 men killed,
wounded, and missing; while the English, Hanoverians,
Dutch, and Austrians acknowledged a total loss of 7,767
men, said by O’Callaghan to be an underestimate. Fontenoy
was one of the greatest of French victories, and led,
in the same campaign, to numerous other successes. Among
the latter may be enumerated the triumph at Melle, the surprise
of Ghent, the occupation of Bruges, and the capture
of Oudenarde, Dendermonde, Ostend, Nieuport, and Ath.</p>

<p class='c009'>Several officers of the Irish Brigade went with Prince
Charles Edward Stuart to Scotland, when he made his gallant
but ill-fated attempt to restore the fallen fortunes of
his luckless father, called by the Jacobites James VIII of
Scotland and James III of England and Ireland, in 1745-46.
The Hanoverian interest called James the “Old” and
Charles Edward the “Young” Pretender. The Irish officers
formed “Prince Charles’s” chosen bodyguard when he was
a fugitive amid the Highlands and Western Isles after Culloden.
One of the last great field exploits of the Irish Brigade
was its victorious charge at Laffeldt, in Flanders, in
1747, when, for the second time, it humiliated Cumberland,
and, in a measure, avenged his base massacre of the gallant
Scottish Highland clans, in 1746. The victory of Laffeldt
led to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which was favorable
to France, in 1748. The Brigade took part in each succeeding
war in which France was involved down to the period
of the Revolution. Some of its regiments served also in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>India and America. Under Count Dillon, several Irish battalions
distinguished themselves in the dashing, but unsuccessful,
attack on the British at Savannah, Ga., in 1779,
when the brave Count Pulaski, who led the assault, was
killed on the ramparts. By that time, however, the volume
of recruits from Ireland had greatly diminished, owing to
the gradual relaxation of the penal code, and a majority
of the officers and soldiers of the Brigade were, although of
Irish blood, French by birth. Some of the officers were
French by both birth and blood, and, among them, in 1791,
was the great-grandson of St. Ruth. The Brigade, as became
it, remained faithful to the last to the Bourbon
dynasty. Unfortunately this fidelity led the feeble remnant,
under Colonel O’Connell, to take service in the West Indies,
beneath the British flag, after the Revolution. In
extenuation of their fault, it must be remembered that they
were, to a man, monarchists; that the Stuart cause was
hopelessly lost, and that both tradition and education made
them the inevitable enemies of the new order of things in
France. Still, an Irish historian may be pardoned for remarking
that it were much better for the fame of the
Brigade of Cremona and Fontenoy if its senile heir-at-law
had refrained from accepting the pay of the country whose
tyranny had driven the original organization into hopeless
exile.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the active career of the bold Brigade terminated in
a blaze of glory. The hand of a prince, destined to be a
monarch, inscribed its proud epitaph when, in 1792, the
Comte de Provence, afterward Louis XVIII, presented
to the surviving officers a drapeau d’adieu, or flag of farewell—a
gold harp wreathed with shamrocks and fleur-de-lis,
on a white ground, with the following touching words:</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>“Gentlemen: We acknowledge the inappreciable services
that France has received from the Irish Brigade in the
course of the last hundred years—services that we shall
never forget, though under an impossibility of requiting
them. Receive this standard as a pledge of our remembrance,
a monument of our admiration and our respect,
and, in future, generous Irishmen, this shall be the motto
of your stainless flag—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c028'>
    <div>“‘1692-1792.’</div>
    <div>“Semper et Ubique Fidelis!</div>
    <div>(“Ever, and everywhere, faithful.”)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Never did military body receive a nobler discharge from
service.</p>

<p class='c009'>And yet, well might the haughty Bourbon prince so
express himself. In defence of his house, there died beneath
the golden lilies, in camp and breach and field, nearly
500,000 of Ireland’s daring manhood. It is no wonder that
with those heroes departed much of her warlike spirit and
springing courage. Her “wild geese,” as she fondly called
them, will never fly again to her bosom across the waves
that aided their flight to exile and to glory. The cannon
of all Europe pealed above their gory graves, on many a
stricken field, the soldier’s requiem.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“They fought as they reveled, fast, fiery, and true,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And, tho’ victors, they left on the field not a few;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And they who survived fought and drank as of yore,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But the land of their hearts’ hope they saw nevermore:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For, in far foreign fields, from Dunkirk to Belgrade,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Lie the soldiers and chiefs of the Irish Brigade!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Its successor in the French army was the Irish Legion,
composed in the main of refugees who had participated in
the “rebellion” of 1798 and the “rising” of 1803. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>fine body of soldiers was organized by Napoleon himself,
wore a distinctively Irish uniform of green and gold, and
carried French and Irish colors. To it, also, was intrusted
an eagle—the only foreign force that was so honored by
the greatest of generals. The Legion fought for the Emperor,
with splendid fidelity, from 1805 to 1815, participating
in most of the great battles of that warlike period.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was naturally expected that Louis XVIII, on his final
restoration to the throne, would revive the old Irish Brigade,
so highly praised by him, when Comte de Provence,
in 1792, but he was under too many obligations to England,
and, in fact, his treaty with that power, after the
second exile of Napoleon, made it obligatory on him not to
accept an Irish military contingent under any consideration.
His acquiescence in this ignoble compact makes more emphatic
the venerable adage, “Put not your trust in Princes.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>WE now approach a period of Irish history from which
we would gladly escape, if we could; a period degrading
to Ireland, disgraceful to England, and shocking
to humanity. We are about to deal with the dark and
bloody period of the revived penal code, in Ireland, following
fast upon the capitulation of Limerick. Many writers
have extolled the fair-mindedness and liberality of William
III, but his course toward Ireland does not sustain the justice
of their eulogies. That he was an indifferentist in
matters of religion is not doubted, yet he permitted persecution
for conscience’ sake in his Irish dominion. That he
was an able man has not been disputed, yet he permitted
English jealousy to destroy the trade and industries of His
own supporters in Ireland, thereby driving thousands on
thousands of the Irish dissenters to the American colonies,
which their descendants, in 1775-83, did so much to make
“free and independent.” We can find nothing to admire
in the Irish policy of William III. Had he been an honest
bigot, a fanatic on the subject of religion, we could understand
his toleration of the legislative abominations which
made the Irish Catholic a helot on his native soil. Had
he been an imbecile we could understand how English plausibility
might have imposed upon him in the matter of Irish
Protestant commerce. However, not much of moral stamina
could be expected from a man who estranged his wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>and his sister-in-law, Anne, from their own father; or from
a nephew, and son-in-law, that did not scruple to play the
cuckoo and eject his own uncle and father-in-law from the
royal nest of England. Add to this his heartless policy toward
the Macdonalds of Glencoe, in Scotland, the order for
whose massacre he countersigned himself, and we find ourselves
utterly unable to give William of Orange credit for
sincerity, liberality, or common humanity. He was personally
courageous, a fair general, and a cautious statesman.
These about summed up his good qualities. But he
interposed no objection when, notwithstanding the solemn
civil articles of Limerick, he permitted the estates of the
adherents of King James, to whom his Lords Justices, by
royal sanction, guaranteed immunity, to be confiscated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mitchel, a Protestant in belief, says in his “History of
Ireland,” page 3: “The first distinct breach of the Articles
of Limerick was perpetrated by King William and his
Parliament in England, just two months after those articles
were signed. King William was in the Netherlands when
he heard of the surrender of Limerick, and, at once, hastened
to London. Three days later he summoned a Parliament.
Very early in the session, the English House of Commons,
exercising its customary power of binding Ireland by acts
passed in London, sent up to the House of Lords a bill
providing that no person should sit in the Irish Parliament,
nor should hold any Irish office, civil, military, or ecclesiastical,
nor should practice law or medicine in Ireland, till he
had first taken the oaths of allegiance <i>and supremacy</i>, and
subscribed to the declaration against transubstantiation. The
law was passed, only reserving the right [of practice] to
such lawyers and physicians as had been within the walls
of Galway and Limerick when those towns capitulated.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Thenceforward there were repeated violations of the treaty,
during the reign of William and Mary, although the penal
laws did not reach the acme of their crushing severity until
the reigns of their immediate successors, Queen Anne,
George I, and George II. Lord Macaulay himself, who
does not admit that William III was ever wrong, acknowledges,
in his “History of England,” that “the Irish Roman
Catholics complained, and with but too much reason, that,
at a later period, the Treaty of Limerick was violated.”
The main opposition to the confirmation of the treaty came,
as might be expected, from the party of Protestant ascendency
in Ireland, which had in view “the glory of God,” and
wholesale confiscation of Catholic property. Their horror
of what they called “Popery” was strongly influenced by
a pious greed for cheap real estate. There were, of course,
many noble exceptions to this mercenary rule among the
Protestants of Ireland, even in the blackest period of “the
penal days.” If there had not been, the Catholics must
have been exterminated. It is only fair to say that the
majority of the poorer Protestant Irish—particularly the
Dissenters—had little or no part in framing the penal
code, and that many members of the Irish House of Lords,
including Protestant bishops, indignantly protested against
the formal violation of the Articles of Limerick, contained
in the act of the “Irish” Parliament, passed in 1695.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Sydney, William’s Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, summoned
the first Irish Parliament of his master’s reign, in
1692, and this was the only Parliament, except that called
together by King James in 1689, which had met in Ireland
in six-and-twenty years. No act of Catholic disqualification
for Parliament existed in Ireland at that time, and,
therefore, a few Catholic lords and commoners presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>themselves, on summons, and took their seats. They had
forgotten that the “paternal” English Parliament had, in
1691, provided for such an emergency, and were taken
aback when the clerks of Parliament presented to them “the
oath of supremacy, declaring the King of England to be
head of the Church, and affirming the sacrifice of the Mass
to be damnable.” Mitchel says, further, of what followed:
“The oath was put to each member of both Houses, and the
few Catholics present at once retired, so that the Parliament,
when it proceeded to business, was purely Protestant.
Here, then, ended the last vestige of constitutional right for
the Catholics; from this date, and for generations to come,
they could no longer consider themselves a part of the existing
body politic of their native land, and the division [of
the Irish] into two nations became definite. There was
the dominant nation, consisting of the British colony, and
the subject nation, consisting of five-sixths of the population,
who had, therefore, no more influence upon public
affairs than have the red Indians of the United States.”
In order to more fully reduce the Catholics of Ireland to the
condition described, an act was passed by the Irish Parliament
in 1697 which provided that “a Protestant marrying
a Catholic was disabled from sitting or voting in either
House of Parliament.” We may add that, following up this
policy, the same Parliament, thirty years later, fearing that
the Catholics were not even yet sufficiently effaced from political
life, passed another bill by which it was enacted that
“no Catholic shall be entitled, or admitted, to vote at the
election of any member to serve in Parliament, as a knight,
citizen, or burgess; or at the election of any magistrate for
any city or other town corporate; any law, statute, or usage
to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>Mitchel, commenting on the severity of the penal laws,
presents a curiously contradictory situation in the Ireland
of King William’s time when he says: “But though the
inhabitants of Ireland were now, counting from 1692, definitively
divided into two castes, there arose immediately,
strange to say, a strong sentiment of Irish nationality—not,
indeed, among the depressed Catholics; they were done
with national sentiment and aspiration for a time—but the
Protestants of Ireland had lately grown numerous, wealthy,
and strong. Their numbers had been largely increased
by English settlers coming to enjoy the plunder of the forfeited
estates, and very much by conversions, or pretended
conversions, of Catholics, who had recanted their faith to
save their property or their position in society, and who generally
altered or disguised their family names when these
had too Celtic a sound. The Irish Protestants also prided
themselves on having saved the kingdom for William and
the ‘Ascendancy,’ and having now totally put down the ancient
nation under their feet, they aspired to take its place,
to rise from a colony to a nation, and to assert the dignity
of an independent kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the Irish Protestant Parliament of 1692 quarreled
with Lord Lieutenant Sydney over a revenue bill, which
originated in London, and which it rejected, although it
passed another bill, having a like origin, on the ground of
emergency. During the debate on these measures, several
members denied the right of England to tax Ireland without
her consent, and insisted that all revenue bills, which
called for Irish taxation, should originate in Ireland, not in
England. This bold spirit angered Lord Sydney, who immediately
prorogued that Parliament, not, however, before
he made an overbearing speech, in which he rebuked the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>of the members and haughtily asserted the supremacy
of the British Parliament over that of Ireland. His remarks
left a sting in Protestant Ireland and served to
strengthen, rather than weaken, the national sentiment alluded
to by Mitchel.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1693, King James the Vacillating, then a pensioner of
the King of France, at St. Germain, issued a declaration to
his former subjects of England in which he made humiliating
promises, at variance with his previous record, and in
which, among other things, he promised if restored to the
throne to keep inviolate the Act of Settlement, which deprived
his Catholic supporters in Ireland of their estates!
This perfidious document aroused great indignation among
the Irish military exiles, and James, through his English
advisers in France, attempted to smooth matters over by
promising that, in the event of his success, he would recompense
all who might suffer by his act, by giving them equivalents.
Lord Middleton, a Scotch peer, is held chiefly responsible
for having led King James into this disgraceful
transaction—the most blameful of his unfortunate career.
“There was no such promise [of recompense] in the declaration”
(to the English), says the historian recently quoted,
“but, in truth, the Irish troops in the army of King Louis
were, at that time, too busy in camp and field, and too
keenly desirous to meet the English in battle, to pay much
attention to anything coming from King James. They had
had enough of ‘Righ Seamus’ at the Boyne Water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Sydney, although inimical to the claim of Irish
Parliamentary independence, was rather friendly to the persecuted
Irish Catholics, and was, therefore, at the request of
the “Ascendancy” faction, speedily recalled, not, however,
before, after two proroguements, he had dissolved the Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>convened in 1692. Three Lords Justices—Lord
Capel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr. Duncombe—were given the
government of Ireland in his stead, but, owing to serious dissensions
among themselves, Capel was finally appointed Lord
Lieutenant, and, in 1695, summoned a new Parliament to
meet in Dublin. This assembly was destined to be infamous.
Its first act was to bring up the articles of the Treaty of Limerick
for “confirmation,” and it “confirmed” them by vetoing
all the important and agreeing to all the trivial provisions.
The enumeration of all the penal laws passed by
this Parliament would be tedious in the extreme, and a
bare outline will suffice to show their demoralizing tendency.
It was enacted that Catholic schoolmasters were forbidden
to teach, either publicly or privately, under severe penalty;
and the parents of Catholic children were prohibited from
sending them to be educated abroad. All Catholics were required
to surrender their arms, and, in order to enforce the
act more thoroughly, “right of search” was given to magistrates,
so that Catholic householders could be disturbed at
any hour of the day or night, their bedrooms invaded, and
the women of their family subjected to exposure and insult.</p>

<p class='c009'>Notwithstanding the clause in the Treaty of Limerick
which was supposed to secure the Catholic landholders in
certain counties in the possession of their property, Parliament
made a clean sweep by confiscating the property of all,
to the extent of over a million acres, so that now, at long
run, after three series of confiscations, there remained in
Catholic hands <i>less than one-seventh</i> of the entire surface
of the island. The Protestant one-sixth owned all the
rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was agreed not to seriously disturb the parish priests,
who were incumbents at the time of the treaty, but no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>curates were allowed them, and they were compelled to
register their names, like ticket-of-leave men, in a book furnished
by government. They had, also, to give security for
their “good conduct,” and there were other insulting exactions—the
emanation of bitter hearts and narrow brains.
All Catholic prelates, the Jesuits, monks, and “regular
clergy,” of whatever order, were peremptorily ordered to
quit Ireland by May 1, 1698. If any returned after that
date, they were to be arrested for high treason, “tried,” and,
of course, condemned and executed. The object was to
leave the Catholic people without spiritual guides, except
Protestants, after the “tolerated” parish priests had passed
away; but, in spite of the penal enactment, a large number
of devoted proscribed bishops and priests remained in Ireland,
and the prelates administered holy orders to young
clerical students, who, like themselves, had defied penalties
and risked their lives for the service of God and the consolation
of their suffering people.</p>

<p class='c009'>In order to still further humiliate the unfortunate Irish
Catholics, this Parliament of bigots decreed that no Catholic
chapel should be furnished with either bell or belfry.
Such smallness would seem incredible in our age, but the
enactments stand out, in all their hideousness, in the old
statutes of the Irish Parliament, still preserved in the government
archives in Dublin and London. It was this Parliament
that decreed, further, that no Catholic could possess
a horse of or over the value of £5 sterling. On offering
that sum, or anything over it, any Protestant could become
owner of the animal.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish peers who protested against this tyranny were
Lords Londonderry, Tyrone, and Duncannon, the Barons
Ossory, Limerick, Killaloe, Kerry, Howth, Kingston, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Strabane, and the Protestant bishops of Kildare, Elphin,
Derry, Clonfert, and Killala—to whom be eternal honor.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the penal laws were not yet completed. They had just
about begun. In 1704, when the Duke of Ormond, grandson
of the Ormond of Cromwellian days, became viceroy
for Queen Anne, another Irish Ascendancy Parliament enacted,
among other things, that the eldest son of a Catholic,
by becoming Protestant, could become the owner of his
father’s land, if he possessed any, and the father become
only a life tenant. If any child, of any age above infancy,
declared itself a Protestant, it was ordered placed under
Protestant guardianship, and the father was compelled to
pay for its education and support. If the wife of a Catholic
turned Protestant, she could claim a third of his property
and separate maintenance. Catholics were prohibited
from being guardians of their own children, to the end that,
when they died, the helpless ones might be brought up as
Protestants.</p>

<p class='c009'>Catholics were debarred from buying land, or taking a
freehold lease for life, or a for a longer period than thirty-one
years. No Catholic heir to a former owner was allowed
to accept property that came to him by right of
lineal descent, or by process of bequest. If any Protestant
could prove that the profit on the farm of a Catholic exceeded
one-third of the rent paid by the latter, the informer
could take immediate possession of the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have already alluded to the measures taken to exclude
Catholics from civil and military service, by operation
of the odious test oaths, which were also used to prevent
them from entering Parliament, and from even voting
for members of Parliament, although the latter had to be
Protestants in order to be eligible. The Irish Dissenters—Presbyterians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>and others—were also subjected to the test-oath
indignity, which, together with the tyrannical restrictions
on trade, imposed by the English and servile Irish
Parliament, drove many thousands of them to America.
The Irish Presbyterians, in particular, resented the “test”
and “schism” acts, and refused to apply to Episcopal bishops
for license to teach in schools; or to receive the sacrament
after the fashion of the Church of England. Rewards
were held out for all who would reveal to the government
the names of Catholics, or others, who might violate the
provisions of the barbaric laws summarized in this chapter.
The scale of the rewards, as given by McGee and other
authors, is a curious study. Thus, “for discovering an archbishop,
bishop, vicar-general, or other person exercising
any foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction, £50; for discovering
each ‘regular’ clergyman and each ‘secular’ clergyman, not
registered, £20, and for discovering each ‘Popish’ schoolmaster,
or usher, £10.” If any person refused to give
evidence of the residence of any proscribed person, he was
fined £20, or else had to go to prison for a year. Many
noble-hearted Protestants who, in spite of penal laws, loved
their Catholic fellow-countrymen, suffered pains and penalties,
under these enactments, and became objects of hatred
to the more malignant section of their co-religionists, who
were after the Catholic spoils. Thus, public distrust became
epidemic, and the infamous “reward” policy begot,
as a natural result, a host of professional informers, whose
shocking avocation was mainly exercised in the spying out
of the places of concealment of proscribed prelates and
priests, and who are still remembered in Ireland as “priest-hunters.”
These malignants also directed their efforts vigorously
against the teachers of “hedge-schools”—that is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>say, schools held in the open air, generally under the shelter
of a tall hedge, or on the edge of a wood, and presided
over by some wandering schoolmaster, who bravely risked
liberty, and often life, in teaching the Catholic youth of
Ireland the rudiments of education.</p>

<p class='c009'>There existed a mean “toleration” of Catholic worship,
in parishes whose priests were “registered,” according to
the provisions of the penal code, but, in parishes where the
priests were not registered, and they were numerous, priests
and people, who wished to celebrate and assist at the consoling
sacrifice of the Mass, had to retire to ocean cave,
or mountain summit, or rocky gorge, in order to guard
against surprise and massacre. The English government
of the day did not scruple to lend its soldiers to the priest-hunters,
to enable the latter to more effectively accomplish
their odious mission; just as in our day it has lent the
military to the sheriffs to carry out those cruel evictions
which the late Mr. Gladstone called “sentences of death.”
It was the custom to place sentinels around the places where
Mass was being celebrated, but, despite of this precaution,
the human sleuthhounds occasionally crept unobserved
upon their unarmed victims—for then, as now, the Irish
were systematically disarmed—and often slew priest and
people at the rude altar stones, called still by the peasantry
“Mass rocks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So great was the enforced exodus of priests from Ireland,
at this awful period of its history, that, says McGee, “in
Rome 72,000 francs annually were allotted for the maintenance
of the fugitive Irish clergy, and, during the first
three months of 1699, three remittances from the Holy
Father, amounting to 90,000 livres, were placed in the
hands of the Nuncio at Paris for the temporary relief of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the fugitives in France and Flanders. It may also be added
here that, till the end of the eighteenth century, an annual
charge of 1,000 crowns was borne by the Papal treasury
for the encouragement of Catholic poor schools in Ireland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of the penal code which produced this dreadful condition
of affairs, in and out of Ireland, Dr. Samuel Johnson,
the great English scholar and philosopher, said, “They are
more grievous than all the Ten Pagan persecutions of the
Christians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Edmund Burke, the illustrious Irish statesman, who
passed most of his career in the British Parliament, and
was, of course, a Protestant, or he could not have sat there,
denounced them, substantially, as the most diabolical engine
of oppression and demoralization ever used against a
people or ever devised by “the perverted ingenuity of man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And the Protestant and English historian, Godkin, who
compiled Cassell’s “History of Ireland,” for English readers,
says of the penal laws: “The eighteenth century was
the era of persecution in which the law did the work of the
sword, more effectually and more safely. There was established
a code framed with almost diabolical ingenuity,
to extinguish natural affection, to foster perfidy and hypocrisy,
to petrify conscience, to perpetuate brutal ignorance,
to facilitate the work of tyranny, by rendering the vices of
slavery inherent and natural in the Irish character, and to
make Protestantism almost irredeemably odious as the
monstrous incarnation of all moral perversions.” This
honest Englishman grows indignant when he says, in continuation,
“Too well did it accomplish its deadly work on
the intellects, morals, and physical condition of a people,
sinking in degeneracy from age to age, till all manly spirit,
all virtuous sense of personal independence and responsibility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>was nearly extinct, and the very features, vacant, timid,
cunning, and unreflective, betrayed the crouching slave
within.... Having no rights or franchises, no legal protection
of life and property, disqualified to handle a gun,
even as a common soldier or a gamekeeper, forbidden to
acquire the elements of knowledge at home or abroad, forbidden
even to render to God what conscience dictated as
His due, what could the Irish be but abject serfs? What
nation in their circumstances could have been otherwise?
Is it not amazing that any social virtue could have survived
such an ordeal?—that any seeds of good, any roots of national
greatness, could have outlived such a long and tempestuous
winter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But the seeds of good, although chilled, did not decay,
and the manly spirit of the Old Irish race—the Celto-Norman
stock, with the former element in preponderance—survived
all its persecutions, and</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The great American orator and philanthropist, Wendell
Phillips, lecturing on Ireland, and alluding to the enforced
ignorance of a former period, said: “When the old-time
ignorance of the Catholic Irish people is reproachfully alluded
to by the thoughtless, or illiberal, it is not Ireland
but England that should bow her head in the dust and put
on sackcloth and ashes!”</p>

    <div>Restrictions on Irish Trade and Manufactures—All Creeds Suffer—Presbyterian Exodus to America—Death of Royal Personages—Accession of George I</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>SINCE the days of Charles II, and probably before his
reign, a contemptible jealousy of the growth of Irish
commerce had taken possession of the commercial element
in England. We have already said something about the
crushing of the Irish cattle trade, while yet the “Merry Monarch”
was on the throne; but a far deadlier blow was struck
at Irish prosperity when, in 1698, the English manufacturers
had the assurance to petition Parliament against the Irish
woolen industry—then among the most prosperous in Europe.
This petition was strongly indorsed by the English
House of Lords, in an address to King William, wherein
they, unconsciously, perhaps, paid a high tribute to Irish
manufacturing genius. They virtually admitted that the
superiority of Irish woolen fabrics made the English traders
apprehensive that the farther growth of the Irish woolen
industry “might greatly prejudice the said manufacture in
his Majesty’s Kingdom of England.” Not content with
this display of mean selfishness, the English fisheries’ interest
protested against Irish fishermen catching herrings on
the eastern coast of their own island, “thereby coming into
competition with them [the English].” The Colonial Parliament
of Ireland basely yielded to English coercion, and,
in 1699, actually stabbed the industries of their own country
in the back, by placing ruinous export duties on fine Irish
woolens, friezes, and flannels! And this hostile legislation
was aimed, not against the Catholic Irish, who had no industries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>but against the Protestant Irish, who possessed
all of them!</p>

<p class='c009'>The English Parliament, thus secured against effective
opposition, immediately passed an act whereby the Irish
people were forbidden to export either the raw material
for making woolen goods, or the goods themselves, to any
foreign port, except a few English ports, and only six of
the numerous Irish seaports were allowed even this poor
privilege. The natural result followed. Irish prices went
up in England, and, in spite of the acknowledged excellence
of Irish manufactures, the English people would not purchase
them at an advanced cost. The Irish traders could
not afford to sell them at a moderate price, and, within a
few years, most of the latter were absolutely ruined. Dr.
P. W. Joyce, in his “History of Ireland,” estimates that
“40,000 Irish Protestants—all prosperous working people—were
immediately reduced to idleness and poverty—the
Catholics, of course, sharing in the misery, so far as they
were employed, and 20,000 Presbyterians and other Nonconformists
left Ireland for New England. Then began
the emigration, from want of employment, that continues
to this day. But the English Parliament professed to encourage
the Irish linen trade, for this could do no harm to
English traders, as flax growing and linen manufacture had
not taken much hold in England.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This, according to Dr. Joyce, was the beginning of
that smuggling trade with France which Ireland carried on
for more than a century, and a close acquaintance, therefore,
sprang up between the French and Irish traders and
sailors. Ireland could sell her surplus wool to great advantage
in France, and received from that country many luxuries,
which, otherwise, she could not have enjoyed. French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>wines became common at Irish tables, above those of the
working-class, and French silks decorated the fair persons of
Irish maids and matrons. Moreover, this adventurous trade
developed a hardy race of Irish sailors, and, by means of the
Irish smugglers and their French copartners, the Irish
priests found a convenient avenue of transit to and from the
Continent; and brave young Irish spirits, registered as
“Wild Geese,” found their way to the ranks of “the bold
Brigade,” whose fame was then a household word in Europe.
But the Irish masses, both Catholic and Nonconformist,
were reduced to abject poverty, and each succeeding
year brought fresh commercial restrictions, until, finally,
almost every Irish industry, except the linen, was totally
extirpated in the island. The smuggling trade, alone, kept
some vitality in the commercial veins of the ruined country,
and, in defiance of English and Anglo-Irish enactments
against it, it continued to flourish down to the beginning of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>Well-meaning foreign writers, who did not make a study
of Anglo-Irish relations in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centuries, have expressed astonishment at the
paucity of Irish industries, outside of linen, and have ascribed
it to Irish non-adaptability to manufacturing pursuits!
Not alone did England compel Ireland to fine her
own traders, by levying export duties on their output, but
she also, as we have seen, by her own Parliament, limited
such exports to the meanest possible proportions! Of course,
at this slavish period of the old so-called Irish Parliament,
duties to limit the importation of English goods and to
foster home industries were not allowed. Ireland was
stripped of everything but linen and “homespun,” and then
left a beggar. This is a most disgraceful chapter in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>history of the political connection of Great Britain and Ireland—one
that led to untold bitterness, and that caused the
great orator, Grattan, in after years to exclaim, prophetically,
in the Irish House of Commons: “What England tramples
in Ireland will rise to sting her in America!” He
alluded to the Presbyterian and Catholic exodus, which so
materially aided the American Revolution.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last hope of King James again attaining the throne
of the “Three Kingdoms” disappeared with the terrible defeat
inflicted on the French fleet at the battle of La Hogue,
1692, and, thereafter, his life was passed sadly—for he had
ample time to ruminate on his misfortunes—at St. Germain,
until he died, in 1701. His rival, William III, whose wife,
Queen Mary II, had preceded him to the grave, died from
the effects of a horseback accident, in March, 1702. He
was immediately succeeded by Queen Anne, the last of the
Stuart line who occupied the throne of England. Her reign
was one of glory for Great Britain and one of hate and horror
for Ireland. We have already mentioned some of the
penal laws passed while she held sway. Her ministers, of
course, were responsible for her acts, because she herself
possessed only moderate ability. Unlike most of the Stuart
family, she swam with the current, and so got along smoothly
with her English subjects. The most important domestic
event of her reign was the legislative union of England with
Scotland—which virtually extinguished Scotland as a nation.
This event occurred in May, 1707, and was accompanied by
acts of the most shameless political profligacy on the part
of the English minister and the Scotch lords and commons.
In fact, the independence of Scotland, like that of Ireland
ninety-three years later, was sold for titles, offices, pensions,
and cold cash. The masses of the people, to do them justice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>had little to do with this nefarious transaction, which was
subsequently satirized by the great Scottish poet, Robert
Burns, in his lyric, one verse of which runs thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What English force could not subdue</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Through many warlike ages,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Is sold now by a craven few</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For hireling traitors’ wages!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The English steel we could disdain—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Secure in valor’s station—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But English gold has been our bane—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The deeds in arms of Anne’s great general, Marlborough,
who was a traitor to both King James and King William,
have been partially related in the chapters bearing on the
career of the Franco-Irish Brigade and need no farther mention
in this history.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the days of William III appeared a pamphlet called
“The Case of Ireland Stated,” which was written by William
Molyneux, a member of Parliament, for the Dublin
University. It appeared in 1698, and made, at once, a
powerful impression on the public mind. It, in brief, took
the ground that Ireland—that is, Protestant, colonial Ireland—was,
of right, a separate and independent kingdom;
that England’s original title of conquest, if she had any, was
abrogated by charters granted to Ireland from time to time,
and, finally, denied that the king and Parliament of England
had power to bind the kingdom and people of Ireland by
English-made laws. The English Parliament was, of course,
greatly shocked and scandalized at the idea of a “mere Irishman”
putting forth such theories, and solemnly ordered his
book to be burned, publicly, by “the common hangman”—a
functionary always in high favor when Ireland needs to
be “disciplined.” The book was burned accordingly, but
its spirit did not die then, nor is it yet dead, or likely to die,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>while Ireland contains a population. King William, in replying
to the English Parliament’s address on the subject of
Molyneux’s utterance, assured its members that “he would
enforce the laws securing the dependence of Ireland on the
imperial crown of Great Britain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the chapter on the penal laws, many of the enactments
of the reign of Anne have been summarized. Her sway
was a moral nightmare over Ireland, and it is a remarkable
historical coincidence that the Green Isle suffered more, materially
and morally, under the English female than the male
sovereigns. Under Elizabeth and Anne, the Irish Catholics
were persecuted beyond belief. Under Victoria’s rule, which
the British statistician, Mulhall, has called “the deadliest
since Elizabeth,” they starved to death by the hundred thousand
or emigrated by the million.</p>

<p class='c009'>The régime of Queen Anne, like that of her predecessors
and successors on the throne, gave the government of Ireland
into the hands of Englishmen, who held all the important
offices, from the viceroyalty downward, and who chose
their sub-officers from among the least national element of
the Irish people. This system, although somewhat modified,
continues to the present day. In the Irish Parliament, there
was an occasional faint display of sectarian nationality, but
it proved of little advantage when the English wanted matters
in that body to go as they wished. Ireland then, as
a majority ruled by a minority, “stood on her smaller end,”
and so it is even in our own times, notwithstanding occasional
“concessions” and “ameliorations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, from the day when the pamphlet, or book, of Molyneux
saw the light, a Patriot party began to grow up in the
Irish Parliament. The old Irish nation had, indeed, disappeared,
for a period, but the new one soon began to manifest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>a spirit that roused the bitter hatred of England. Such
infatuated Irish Protestants as still believed that they would
be more gently treated on account of common creed with
the stronger people were soon bitterly undeceived.</p>

<p class='c009'>The death of Queen Anne, all of whose children by the
Prince of Denmark had died before her, occurred in July,
1714. It is said that she secretly favored the succession of
her half-brother, acknowledged by Louis XIV, and the Jacobite
party in Great Britain, as James III of that realm, but
the last Duke of Ormond, the Earl of Orrery, Bishop Atterbury,
and Lord Bolingbroke, the Jacobite leaders in England,
lost their nerve after the Queen’s death and allowed
the golden opportunity of proclaiming the exiled Stuart
king to pass away. The Hanoverian faction, which called
James “the Pretender,” took advantage of their vacillation
to proclaim the Elector of Hanover, who derived his claim
from the Act of Succession or Settlement (which ignored
the Stuart male line, or any of its Catholic collateral
branches, and excluded them from the throne), under the
title of George I. He derived his claim, such as it was,
from James I, whose daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, had
married the King of Bohemia. Her daughter, Sophia, married
the Elector of Hanover and became mother of King
George, who was a thorough German in speech, manner,
and habit, although not in person or in manly characteristics.
But he was a Protestant, and that sufficed for
England. On August 1, 1714, he was proclaimed in
London and Edinburgh, and on the 8th of that month
in Dublin. The Scotch Jacobites ridiculed his accession
in a racy “skit,” which began with—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, wha the deil hae we got for a king</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But a wee, wee German lairdie!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>Ireland, broken in spirit and disgusted by the memory of
King James II, remained quiescent, but, in 1715, Scotland
and a portion of the north of England rose in rebellion,
the former under the Earl of Mar and the latter under young
Lord Derwentwater. They were not heartily supported.
Both met with defeat, and Derwentwater, together with several
English and Scotch adherents of note, was captured,
beheaded, and had his estates confiscated to the “crown.”
The English Parliament offered a reward of £50,000 ($250,000)
for the “apprehension” of “the Pretender,” who had
been previously “attainted,” but there were no takers, “the
Pretender” aforesaid being safely housed in Paris. This
bloody episode ended Jacobite “risings” in Great Britain for
a generation.</p>

    <div>Further Commercial Restrictions—Continued Exodus of Working People—Jonathan Swift—“The Patriot Party”—Tyranny of Primate Boulter</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>SEEING that Ireland had taken no part in the attempted
Stuart revolution at the beginning of his reign, it might
be imagined that George I showed some favor to the Irish
people, but he did nothing of the kind. On the contrary,
the penal laws were enforced with greater virulence than
ever, and several new enactments of a most oppressive character—chiefly
bearing on the franchise—were passed. In
1719, the Patriot party in the Irish Parliament threw down
a challenge to English supremacy. The Irish House of
Lords annulled, on appeal, from the Dublin Court of Exchequer,
a judgment in favor of one Annesley and gave it to
the opposition litigant, Hester Sherlock. The former appealed
to the English lords, who overrode the decision of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Irish House, by reversing judgment in favor of Annesley.
As the sheriff in whose jurisdiction (Kildare) the writ ran
refused to obey the English decree, he was heavily fined.
The Irish House retaliated by remitting the fine, applauding
the sheriff and arresting the judges of the Dublin court
who had decided for Annesley. The anger of England became
boundless, as it usually does when Ireland asserts itself,
and the English Parliament, without color of right, passed
the drastic enactment, known as the 6th of George I, which
definitively bound Ireland by English enactments, and took
the right of appeal away from the Irish House of Peers.
Thus was the chain begun by the Poynings’ Law, in the
reign of Henry VII, made complete, and, at one fell swoop,
Ireland was reduced to a provincial status. Thenceforth,
until 1780, the Irish Parliament was merely a machine for
registering the will of England, in the matter of Irish government.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the same time, England continued her war on the few
remaining Irish industries—nothing seemed to satisfy the
jealousy and covetousness of her merchants. The glaring
outrages committed against the business of Ireland aroused
the ire of the famous Jonathan Swift, Protestant Dean of
St. Patrick’s, who was the son of an Englishman. He
wrote, anonymously, several bitter pamphlets against the
selfish policy of England, and urged the Irish people to use
nothing but native manufactures. In one of these fulminations,
he used the memorable phrase: “Burn everything that
comes from England, except the coal!” But his patriotic
influence rose to the zenith when he attacked “Wood’s half-pence”—base
money coined to meet a financial emergency—in
1723. His philippics became known as the “Drapier’s
letters” from the signature attached to them, and, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>end, he compelled the government to cancel the contract
with Wood. England foamed with rage, and had the printer
of the letters prosecuted. However, no judge or jury in
Dublin was found vile enough to convict him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Swift, although an Irish patriot, was a Protestant bigot,
and detested the Celtic Catholics quite as much as he did the
English, whom, from a political standpoint, he hated. Yet,
he was the idol, during his long lifetime, of the Catholics,
because he had stood by Ireland against the common enemy.
This brilliant man, whose writings have made him immortal,
and whose private sorrows can not be estimated, finally
“withered at the top,” and died insane, after having willed
his property to be used for the building of a lunatic asylum.
In a poem written some time before his sad death, he alludes
to his bequest in the following lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He left what little wealth he had</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To build a house for fools and mad—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To show, by one sarcastic touch,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>No nation needed one so much!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>No writer better knew how to enrage the English. He
took a savage delight in tormenting them, wounding their
vanity, and exposing their weaknesses. Neither did he
spare the Irish; and, as for the Scotch, he rivaled Dr. Samuel
Johnson in his dislike of that people. In our day, the
average summer-up of merits and demerits would describe
Jonathan Swift as “a gifted crank.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Associated with him in the moral war against English
interference in Ireland’s domestic concerns were such other
shining lights of the period as Dr. Sheridan, ancestor of
Richard Brinsley, and others of that brilliant “ilk”: Dr.
Stopford, the able Bishop of Cloyne, and Doctors Jackson,
Helsham, Delaney, and Walmsley, nearly all men of almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>pure English descent. McGee also credits “the three reverend
brothers Grattan”—a name subsequently destined to
immortality—with good work in the same connection.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever the private faults of Swift, Ireland must ever
hold his memory in reverence, with those of many other
Irish non-Catholic patriots, who, although they had little
or no Celtic blood in their veins, and were brought up under
English influences, nobly preferred the interests of their
unfortunate native country to the smiles and favors of her
oppressors. And so Ireland, considering these things,
blesses</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“—The men of patriot pen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Swift, Molyneux, and Lucas,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>as fervently as if they belonged to the race of the Hy-Niall
or Kinel-Conal.</p>
<p class='c009'>Nor must it be supposed that the Patriot element, led by
Swift, escaped persecution at the hands of the Protestant oligarchy,
although they, too, were of the Established Church.
Swift himself was discriminated against all his life, because
of his advocacy of Irish manufactures, his discrediting of
Wood’s “brass money,” and his defeat of the mischievous
national bank project, which was germane to it. As diocese
after diocese became vacant in Ireland, he saw dullards
promoted to the sees, while he was deliberately overlooked,
simply because he had advocated justice to Ireland! This
injustice afterward passed into a proverb. Said an Irish
orator, in after years, speaking of another great Irishman
who had also suffered from English resentment: “The
curse of Swift was upon him—to have been born an Irishman,
to have been blessed with talents, and to have used
those talents for the benefit of his country!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Swift was not the only sufferer. There were other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>distinguished offenders against English sentiment. It is
true they had not provoked the government by their writings
to offer a reward of £300 for their identity, as was
Swift’s fortune, but they had done enough to be made “horrible
examples” of. Thus, Right Rev. Dr. Browne, Protestant
Bishop of Cork, had been threatened with deprivation
for protesting against the insulting language toward
Catholics contained in the notorious Orange toast to the
memory of William III; and Dr. Sheridan was deprived of
his “living” in Munster, because, says McGee, “he accidentally
chose for his text on the anniversary of King George’s
coronation: ‘Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof!’
Such,” he continues, “was the intolerance of the oligarchy
toward their own clergy. What must it have been to
others!”</p>

<p class='c009'>About this period, too, the differences between Episcopalians
and Nonconformists—the latter having again repudiated
the test oaths—became more bitter than ever. Swift
took sides against the Dissenters, whom, as a fierce Church
of England champion, he despised. “They were glad,” he
said, they or their fathers, “to leave their barren hills of
Lochaber for the fruitful vales of Down and Antrim.” He
denied to them, with bitter scorn, the title they had assumed
of “Brother Protestants,” and as to the Papists they affected
to contemn, they were, in his opinion, “as much superior
to the Dissenters as a lion, though chained and
clipped of its claws, is a stronger and nobler animal than
an angry cat, at liberty to fly at the throats of true churchmen.”
Of course, the Church of England faction triumphed
and the exodus of the Nonconformists from Ireland received
a fresh impetus. “Outraged,” says McGee, “in
their dearest civil and religious rights, thousands of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>Scoto-Irish of Ulster, and the Milesian and Anglo-Irish
of the other provinces, preferred to encounter the perils
of the wild Atlantic rather than abide under the yoke and
lash of such an oligarchy. In the year 1729, five thousand
six hundred Irish landed at the single port of Philadelphia;
in the next ten years they furnished to the Carolinas and
Georgia the majority of their immigrants; before the end
of this reign [George I] several thousands of heads of families,
all bred and married in Ireland, were rearing up a
free posterity along the slopes of the Blue Ridge in Virginia
and Maryland, and even as far north as the valleys
of the Hudson and the Merrimac. In the ranks of the
thirteen United Colonies, the descendants of those Irish
Nonconformists were to repeat, for the benefit of George
III, the lesson and example their ancestors had taught to
James II at Inniskillen and Derry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We do not purpose entering into a chronological account
of the several viceroys—most of them rather obscure—who
represented English misgovernment in Ireland during
the reigns of the early Georges. They simply followed out
the old programme of oppression and repression with tiresome
monotony. No matter who “held court” in Dublin
Castle, the policy of England toward Ireland remained unchanged.
If ever there came a lull in the course of systematic
persecution, it followed immediately on some reverse
of the English arms on the Continent of Europe. An English
victory meant added taxes and further coercion for
the Irish Catholics and Dissenters.</p>

<p class='c009'>George I had died in 1727, leaving behind him an unsavory
moral reputation, and regretted by nobody in England,
except his Hanoverian mistresses, who were noted for
their pinguid ugliness. He was succeeded without opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>by his son, who mounted the throne as George II. He,
too, was small of stature, un-English in language and appearance,
and inherited the vices of his father. He was
not deficient in personal bravery, as he proved at Dettingen,
and elsewhere, in after times, and he had the distinction
of being the last king of England who appeared upon
a field of battle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The penal code was continued in full force during most
of this reign, although it had lost favor among the English
governing class in the time of the king’s father, when the
Protestant Ascendency party in the Irish Commons brazenly
proposed to the English Privy Council the passage of an
act whereby a proscribed prelate or priest arrested in Ireland
would be made to suffer indecent mutilation. Bad as
the English privy councilors generally were, where Ireland
was concerned, they would not stomach such revolting savagery,
and the hideous proposition was heard of no more.
And yet England, knowing the ferocious character of the
fanatics who proposed it, left Ireland virtually helpless in
their hands! She could have, at any time, put an end to
the intolerable persecutions visited upon the masses of the
people by a heartless oligarchy, actuated about equally by
cupidity and fierce intolerance. Had she done so, she might
have won the Irish heart, as France won that of German
Alsace and Italian Corsica, but she preferred to use one
section of the Irish people against the other, in her lust of
empire, and “Divide and Conquer” became, as in the Elizabethan
times, the pith of her Irish policy.</p>

<p class='c009'>The great English minister, Sir Robert Walpole, impressed
by the necessity of breaking down the spirit of independence
evoked by Swift and his able and patriotic colleagues,
who had indeed “breathed a new soul” into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>Ireland of their day, appointed that inveterate politician
and corrupt diplomat, Lord Carteret, viceroy. He also promoted
the Right Rev. Hugh Boulter, Bishop of Bristol,
also an Englishman of the virulent type, to the Archbishopric
of Armagh—the primal see of Ireland. Boulter
was Castlereagh’s precursor in policy. Possessed of high
office and vast wealth, he did not hesitate to use both prestige
and money in the interests of England, and his corruption
of many members of the Irish Parliament was so
open and flagrant as to scandalize even the brazen chiefs
of the atrocious “Court party”—the Prætorean guard of
Lord Carteret. This unscrupulous churchman was the virtual
head of the English interest in Ireland for eighteen
years, and, within that period, overshadowing even viceregal
authority, he made the English name more hated
among not alone the Celtic, but the Scoto and Anglo-Irish
than it had been for a century. He was the greatest persecutor
of the Catholics that had appeared since the period
of Cromwell, and he it was who manipulated the machinery
of Parliament to deprive them of the last vestige of their
civil and religious liberty in the closing days of the brutal
reign, in Ireland, of George I. Nor did the Presbyterians
and other dissenters fare much better at his hands. His
black career terminated in 1742, and a weight of horror
was lifted from Ireland’s heart when the welcome news of
his death spread rapidly, far and wide, over the persecuted
country.</p>

<p class='c009'>What made “Primate Boulter” particularly odious to the
Catholic people of Ireland was his institution of the “Charter
Schools”—used openly and insultingly for the perversion
of the majority of the population from the Roman
Catholic faith. Since that period, English politicians have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>not hesitated to use the influence of the Roman See, with
more or less success, to curb political movements in Ireland.
Even then, when England was enforcing the penal
laws against the Irish Catholics with fire and sword, she
was the ally of Catholic Austria against the French, and
glibly advocated toleration for the Protestants of the Hapsburg
empire, while her “priest-hunters” industriously earned
their putrid “blood money” in unfortunate, Catholic Ireland.
We may say, in passing, that Primate Boulter was
succeeded in the primacy by another Englishman, Right
Rev. George Stone, who proved himself worthy of his
predecessor.</p>

<div class='nf-center c019'>
    <div>Official Extravagance—Charles Lucas, Leader of Irish Opposition—Chesterfield Viceroy—His Recall—Dorset’s Vile Administration</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>AN attempt made in 1729 to place an extortionate estimate
on the public expenses, and which emanated
from “the Castle of Dublin,” had the effect of consolidating
the Irish opposition in Parliament. These legislators protested
in a dignified manner against extravagance in public
expenditure. Under the administration of the Duke of
Devonshire, in 1737, they set their faces against his method
of corrupting the public conscience by a display of lavish
generosity, which is always popular in a capital where trade
depends to a great extent on courtly favor. The leaders
in the House of Commons were Sir Edward O’Brien, of
the House of Inchiquin; his son, Sir Lucius; the Speaker,
Henry Boyle, and Mr. Anthony Malone, whose father had
been an efficient ally of Sir Toby Butler, in defending Catholic
rights under the articles of Limerick.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>These gentlemen were ably assisted by Dr. Charles Lucas,
who, although not a member of the House, possessed a vast
outside influence, because of his great talent and moral
worth. The doctor was also a druggist by profession, but
could use a virile pen even better than he could a pestle and
mortar. In 1741, he began hammering the government in
public prints, on the lines of Molyneux and Swift, and with
almost as great success. But “the Castle” censor came
down upon him, and he was compelled to leave Ireland for
a period. Like Swift, he was rather antagonistic to Catholic
claims, but, as in the case of the great Dean, the Catholics
forgave him because he was true to Ireland. After
some years of exile, he returned to Dublin, was elected to
Parliament, and became a leader of the Patriots in the
House of Commons. In the House of Lords, the Earl of
Kildare, afterward first Duke of Leinster, was the Patriot
leader.</p>

<p class='c009'>The famous Earl of Chesterfield became Viceroy of Ireland
in 1745, and showed, from the first, a thorough disgust
for the penal laws and the oligarchs who supported
them. He connived at Catholic toleration to such an extent
that he became an object of suspicion, if not of hatred, to
the Ascendency faction. The government of England, with
habitual cunning, had selected this finished courtier to rule
in Ireland, because of disquieting rumors of an invasion of
Great Britain contemplated by Charles Edward Stuart, son
of “the Pretender,” James III. Also, about the same time,
came the stirring news of the victory of the Irish Brigade,
in alliance with the French, over the Duke of Cumberland’s
column at glorious Fontenoy. “Accursed,” old
George II is said to have exclaimed, on being told of the
Franco-Irish victory, “accursed be the laws that deprive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span><i>me</i> of such soldiers!” But Chesterfield was, in reality,
friendly to the Irish. He liked their wit and esprit and
took no pains to conceal the fact, greatly to the disgust of
the Ascendency clique. But Charles Edward’s attempt to
recover the British crown utterly failed. Highland Scotland
fought for him heroically. The Jacobites of England
held, for the most part, aloof, and, beyond the officers of
the Irish Brigade, who went with him from France, Ireland
hardly furnished a man to aid his hardy and romantic enterprise—thus
showing how completely her spirit was subdued
during that momentous crisis. Charles Edward was
a leader that, in the preceding century, the Irish would have
been proud to follow. He was a great improvement on
both his sire and grandsire, although he ended miserably,
in his old age, a career begun so gloriously in his youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chesterfield remained only eight months in his Irish office.
He was recalled within ten days after the battle of Culloden.
There was no further need, for the time being, to conciliate
the Irish. The heir of the unhappy Stuarts was a houseless
wanderer in the land over which his forefathers had reigned
for centuries and their cause was hopelessly lost. The Earl
and Countess of Chesterfield, on their departure from Dublin,
received “a popular ovation.” They walked on foot,
arm in arm, from the viceregal residence to the wharf, where
lay the vessel that was to bear them back to England, and
the warm-hearted, “too easily deluded people” prayed loud
and fervently for their speedy return. They came back no
more, but Chesterfield was enabled to assure George II, when
he reached London, that the only “dangerous Papist” he
had seen in Ireland was the lovely Miss Ambrose, afterward
Mrs. Palmer, Dublin’s reigning beauty of the period. Chesterfield
made much of her at “the Castle,” and laughed politely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>at the bigots who looked upon her as a species of Delilah.
As Miss Ambrose enjoyed, also, the friendship of
Lady Chesterfield, her enemies could evoke no scandal from
the platonic intimacy. The earl’s mild, insinuating system of
government had enabled him to spare four regiments from
Ireland for service in Scotland, during the Jacobite insurrection.
His “Principles of Politeness,” practically applied,
were much more effective in the cause of the House of Hanover
than all the repressive enactments of the vicious bigots
of the party of Ascendency.</p>

<p class='c009'>The last Jacobite expedition was organized in France, in
1759, and was under orders of an admiral named Conflans,
who, when a short distance out from Brest, was encountered
by an English fleet under Admiral Hawke and
totally defeated. A wing of this expedition, under Commodore
Thurot, whose real name was O’Farrell, did not arrive
in time to take part in the battle, but succeeded in entering
the British Channel without interruption. A storm arose
which drove Thurot’s five frigates to seek shelter in Norway
and the Orkney Islands, where they wintered. In the spring,
one frigate made its way back to France. Another sailed
with a similar object, but was never heard from afterward.
The remaining three, under Thurot, made for the Irish
coast and entered Lough Foyle, but made no attempt on
Londonderry. They soon headed for Belfast Lough, and
appeared before Carrickfergus about the end of February,
1760. Thurot demanded the surrender of the place, which
was stoutly refused by the military governor, Colonel Jennings.
The Franco-Irish sailor immediately landed his fighting
men and took the town by a rapid and furious assault.
Then he levied on the place for supplies and again put to
sea. Off the Isle of Man he fell in with three newly commissioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>ships of war under the English Commodore,
Elliott. A sanguinary encounter followed. Thurot, alias
O’Farrell, and three hundred of his marines and sailors were
killed. The French vessels were fearful wrecks, and the
victorious English towed them in a sinking condition into
Ramsay. Thus terminated one of the most gallant naval
episodes of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Earl of Harrington, afterward Duke of Devonshire,
became Lord Lieutenant some time after the recall of
Lord Chesterfield, the odious Primate Stone—accused both
in England and Ireland of unspeakable immorality—ruled
Ireland as completely as had his less filthy predecessor, Primate
Boulter. Ireland, at the outset of the new régime, was
astonished to find a respectable surplus in her treasury, and
Lord Chesterfield, who always, while he lived, took a deep
interest in Irish affairs, sent a congratulatory letter on the
seeming prosperity of the country to his friend, the Bishop
of Waterford. The Patriot party in the Commons, led by
the sagacious and eloquent Malone, advocated the expenditure
of the surplus on public works and needed public buildings
throughout Ireland and in the capital. But Stone and
the Castle ring fought the proposition bitterly, contending
that the money belonged to the crown and could be drawn by
royal order on the vice-treasurer, without regard to Parliament.
When the Duke of Dorset succeeded Harrington
as viceroy, in 1751, the question had reached an acute stage.
Opposition to the royal claim on the Irish surplus had led
to the expulsion of Dr. Lucas from Ireland. But Malone
and Speaker Boyle kept up the fight in the Commons, and,
after having sustained one defeat, on a full vote, finally
came out victorious by having the supply bill, which covered
all government service in the kingdom, thrown out by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>a vote of 122 to 117. Government showed its resentment
by canceling Malone’s patent of precedence as Prime Sergeant,
and striking Speaker Boyle’s name from the list of
privy-councilors. This was outrageous enough, but what
followed was still more so. The king (George II) by advice
of Dorset, Stone, and their clique, overrode the action
of the Irish Parliament and despotically, by operation of
a king’s letter, withdrew the long-disputed surplus from the
Irish national treasury. This crowning infamy was consummated
in 1753, and so great became public indignation
that Stone and the obnoxious ministers were mobbed, and
the Duke of Dorset could not appear on the streets of Dublin
without being hooted at and otherwise insulted. Anglo-Ireland
seemed on the brink of revolution, but the popular
leaders took a conservative attitude and thus avoided a
violent crisis. Dorset, alarmed by the tempest he had himself
created, virtually fled from Dublin, followed by the
execration of the multitude. He left the government in the
hands of three Lords Justices, one of whom was Primate
Stone, whose very name was hateful to the incensed people.</p>

<p class='c009'>The viceroy was followed to England by the popular
leader of the Irish House of Lords, James Fitz-Gerald, 20th
Earl of Kildare, who had married the daughter of the
Duke of Richmond, and, consequently, had a powerful English
backing. Kildare presented to King George, in person,
a memorial in which he strongly denounced the misgovernment
of Ireland by Dorset, Stone, and Lord George
Sackville, Dorset’s intermeddling son. This memorial has
been described as “the boldest ever addressed by a subject
to a sovereign.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Although Lord Holderness, an English courtier, in a
letter to Chancellor Jocelyn, says that the bold Geraldine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>“was but ill-received and very coolly dismissed” by the
king, Kildare’s policy soon prevailed in Ireland. Dorset
was recalled in the succeeding year, and Primate Stone, with
whom Kildare refused to act as Lord Justice, was removed
from the ministry of Ireland.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Duke of Devonshire, formerly Lord Harrington, or
Hartington, succeeded Dorset, and immediately began the
congenial work, to an English statesman, of breaking up,
and rendering harmless, the Irish Patriot party. Boyle was
made Chancellor of the Exchequer and was raised to the
peerage as the Earl of Shannon, receiving also a pension
of £2,000 per annum for thirty-one years. Malone would
have accepted the Lord Chancellorship gladly, but was restrained
by both private and public opinion from doing so
openly. But Mitchel says that while Boyle remained nominal
chancellor, Malone quietly pocketed the profits of the
position, and his patriotic eloquence declined in proportion
to the growth of his profits. Other leaders of the Patriot
party were also “taken care of,” and England managed to
get rid of one of her most troublesome “Irish difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The purchased Patriots, however, may be fairly credited
with having forced the beginning of the public works,
such as canals and highways, in Ireland, and the construction
of some of those splendid official edifices which still,
even in their decay, “lend an Italian glory to the Irish
metropolis.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Kildare stands accused of having entered into the
negotiations with the new viceroy for the “placation” of
the Patriot party in the Commons. Such, however, were
the political “morals” of the times, and the offices were,
nominally at least, Irish and, therefore, quasi, not fully,
national—seeing that Ireland was what might be called a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>semi-independent colonial province, distrustful of England,
but without strength or resolution to snap her chains. The
earl soon became Marquis of Kildare, and, subsequently,
Duke of Leinster, but he is best remembered as the father
of the gallant, unselfish, and devoted Lord Edward Fitzgerald,
of 1798 fame.</p>

<p class='c009'>An attempt made, in March, 1756, to pass a bill in the
Irish Commons to vacate the seats of such members as
should accept “any pension or civil office of profit from
the crown,” was defeated by a vote of 85 to 59—thus giving
plain notice to the English viceroy that the Parliament
was up for auction, and, within less than fifty years from
that date, it was, accordingly, like that of Scotland, “knocked
down to the highest bidder.” How could it be otherwise?
When, as Mitchel truly says in his Continuation of McGeoghegan’s
“History of Ireland,” “The English Protestant
colony in Ireland, which aspired to be a nation, amounted
to something under half a million of souls, in 1754. It
was out of the question that it should be united on a footing
of equality with its potent mother country by ‘the
golden link of the crown,’ because the wearer of that crown
was sure to be guided in his policy by English ministers,
in accordance with English interests; and, as the army was
the king’s army, he could always enforce that policy. The
fatal weakness of the colony was that it would not amalgamate
with the mass of the Irish people (<i>i.e.</i> the Catholics)
so as to form a true nation, but set up the vain pretension
to hold down a whole disfranchised people with one hand
and defy all England with the other.” And this insensate
policy was pursued, with little modification, to the end,
and in the end proved fatal to both “the colony” and the
nation.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE Duke of Bedford became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
in 1757, and came as a “conciliator,” with a smile on
his face “and a bribe in his pocket.” His mission was to
“soften” the penal laws, which had again become too scandalous
for the “liberal” and “civilized” reputation of England
on the Continent. One Miss O’Toole, a Catholic, had
been pressed by some Protestant friends to “conform” to
the Established Church, so as to avoid persecution, and fled
to the house of a relative named Saul, who resided in Dublin,
in order to escape disagreeable importunity. Mr. Saul
was prosecuted and convicted, under the penal code, and the
judge who “tried” the case said, in his charge, that “Papists
had no rights,” because the “law” under which poor Saul
was punished “did not,” in the language of the court, “presume
a Papist to exist in the kingdom, nor could Papists
so much as breathe the air without the connivance of government!”
This judge, harsh as his language may now seem,
did not misstate the case, for such, indeed, was the barbarous
“law of the land” at that period, and for a considerable
time afterward.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bigots in the Irish Commons, soon after the arrival
of the Duke of Bedford in Dublin, had prepared a new and
even more drastic bill of penalties against Catholics than
already existed, and so intolerable were its proposals that
several leading Catholics among “the nobility, gentry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>professional [clandestinely] classes” got together, and, after
a time, formed, in out-of-the-way meeting places, the first
“Catholic Committee” of Ireland—the precursor, by the
way, of the many similar organizations conducted by John
Keogh, Daniel O’Connell, and other Catholic leaders of succeeding
generations.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief men of this committee were Charles O’Conor,
the Irish scholar and antiquary; Dr. Curry, the historical
reviewer; Mr. Wyse, a leading merchant of the city of
Waterford; Lords Fingal, Devlin, Taaffe, and some others
less known to fame. These amiable gentlemen were, at
first, frightened by the sound of their own voices, but they
gradually grew bolder, although they did not proceed far
enough to bring down upon their heads the full wrath of
“government.” Indeed, they were, on most occasions, obsequiously
“loyal” to the “crown,” which meant the English
king and connection. But the iron had entered their souls,
and the stain of its corrosion lingered long in their veins.
When the Duke of Bedford, by the instructions of the elder
Pitt (Chatham), who acted for King George, informed the
Irish Parliament that France contemplated a new invasion
and called upon the Irish people to show their loyalty to the
House of Hanover, Charles O’Conor drew up an abjectly
“loyal” address, which was signed by 300 leading Catholics,
and had it presented at the bar of the House of Commons
(Dublin) by Messrs. Antony MacDermott and John
Crump. The speaker, Mr. Ponsonby, received the document
in dead silence, laid it on the table in front of him, and coolly
bowed the delegation out. The Duke of Bedford, however,
took “gracious” notice of the address, and caused his answer
thereto, which was appreciative—England being then in
mortal terror of the French—to be printed in the Dublin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>“Gazette,” which was the “government’s” official organ.
And the poor Catholic gentlemen, who had signed the cringing
document, went into convulsions of joy because of this
“official recognition” of their slavish professions of “loyalty”
to a foreign king, who cared less for them than for the
blacks of the West Indies!</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mitchel, the Protestant historian, who understood
his country’s sad story better, perhaps, than any writer who
ever dealt with it, makes for the Catholic committee this
ingenious apology: “We may feel indignant,” says he, “at
the extreme humility of the proceedings of the committee,
and lament that the low condition of our countrymen at
that time left no alternative but that of professing a hypocritical
‘loyalty’ to their oppressors; for the only other alternative
was secret organization to prepare an insurrection
for the total extirpation of the English colony in Ireland,
and, carefully disarmed as the Catholics were [and still
are], they, doubtless, felt this to be an impossible project.
Yet, for the honor of human nature, it is necessary to state
the fact that this profession of loyalty, to a king of England,
was, in reality, insincere. Hypocrisy, in such a case,
is less disgraceful than would have been a genuine canine
attachment to the hand that smote and to the foot that
kicked.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Bedford, in his policy of conciliation, had even a
deeper motive than fear of France. The statesmen of England,
jealous of even the poor and almost impotent colonial
Parliament of Ireland, so early as 1759, contemplated that
“legislative union,” which was to be effected in later times.
Bedford’s design was the truly English one of arraying the
Irish Catholics against the Protestant nationalists, who had,
with England’s willing aid, so cruelly persecuted them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>When this project got mooted abroad, the Protestant mob
of Dublin—the Catholics were too cowed at the time to
act, and their leaders were committed to Bedford by their
address—rose in their might, on December 3, 1759, surrounded
the Houses of Parliament and uttered tumultuous
shouts of “No Union! no Union!” They stopped every
member of Parliament, as he approached to enter the
House, and made him swear that he would oppose the
union project. They violently assaulted the Lord Chancellor,
whom they believed to be a Unionist, together with
many other lords, spiritual and secular, and “ducked” one
member of the Privy Council in the river Liffey. The
Speaker and Secretary of the House of Commons had to appear
in the portico of the House and solemnly assure the
people that no union was contemplated. Even this assurance
did not quell the tumult, and, finally, a fierce charge
of dragoons and the bayonets of a numerous infantry, accompanied
by a threat of using cannon, cleared the streets.
Following up the policy of “conciliation,” the Catholic leaders,
with slavish haste, repudiated the actions of the Protestant
mob, and thus produced a contemptuous bitterness
in the Protestant mind, which aggravated the factious feeling
in the unfortunate country. England’s work was well
done. She had planted, as a small seed, the idea of absorbing
the Irish Parliament some day, and was willing to
let it take its own time to ripen into Dead Sea fruit for
Ireland. The Catholic helot had been cunningly played off
against his Protestant oppressor, and thus the subject nation
had been made the forger of its own fetters—at least in
appearance, although England was the real artificer. Many
Catholics in humble life may have joined in the Dublin anti-union
riots, but the Catholic chiefs, who had their own axe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>to grind, were resolved to appear “loyal”—all the more so
because some of the Protestant leaders in the late disorders
sought to fasten the responsibility on the members of the
proscribed faith. The outbreak, as was well known, was
mainly the work of the followers of Dr. Lucas, then in exile,
but soon to be a Member of Parliament, and the fiercest
opponent of a legislative union with Great Britain.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It deserves remark,” says a historian of the period,
“that on this first occasion, when a project of a legislative
union was really entertained by an English ministry, the
Patriot party which opposed it was wholly and exclusively
of the Protestant colony, and that the Catholics of Ireland
were totally indifferent, and, indeed, they could not rationally
be otherwise, as it was quite impossible for them to
feel an attachment to a national legislature in which they
were not represented, and for whose members they could
not even cast a vote.”</p>

<p class='c009'>George II died of “rupture of the heart”—probably from
the bursting of an arterial aneurism in that region—in 1760.
He was never popular in England, because of his German
ways and affections, and the Irish people regarded him with
indifference. They had never seen him, and he was about
as much of a stranger in his Irish realm as the Shah of
Persia or the Khan of Tartary. His reign had lasted
twenty-eight years, and, in all that period, the estimated
population of Ireland—for there was no regular census—increased
only 60,000. Presbyterian and Catholic emigration
to the colonies—superinduced by the penal laws against
both—was mainly the cause of this remarkable stagnation.
There had been two famines also, and the victims of artificial
scarcity—a condition produced by restrictions on trade
and manufacture—were numerous.</p>

    <div>Accession of George III—His Character—Boasts of Being “a Briton”—Death of Dr. Lucas—Lord Townsend’s Novel Idea of Governing Ireland—Septennial Parliament Refused</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE long reign of George III, grandson of the late
monarch, began in the month of October, 1760, when
he had attained the age of 22 years. His father, Frederick
Louis, Prince of Wales, was a dissolute and almost
imbecile person, and was hated by his own father, George
II, with a most unnatural hatred. No doubt he, in great
measure, deserved it, for a member of his own family
described Frederick Louis as being “the greatest brute and
ass in Christendom.” George III, when he mounted the
English throne, was a dull, commonplace young man, without
pronounced personal vices, but exceedingly obstinate
and subject to spells of temper, when strongly opposed,
that gave assurance of future mental weakness. He was
not, by nature, cruel, but circumstances developed gross
cruelty under his régime, in India, in America, and in Ireland.
He had enough of the Stuart blood in him to be a
stickler for “the right divine” of kings, and he was enough
of a Guelph to have his own way with even his most persuasive
ministers. His father’s politics, so far as he had
any, leaned toward Whiggery, but after that prince’s death
his mother had placed him under the tutelage of the Marquis
of Bute, who was an ardent Tory. Consequently, the
young king had had the advantage of being taught in the
two great English schools of policy, but, in the long run,
the Tory in his nature prevailed over the Whig, and George
III finally developed into a fierce and intolerant despot.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>All that could be said in his favor was that, after he married—and
he married young—his court became, at once, a
model of propriety and dulness. The painted harlots, fostered
by his grandfather and great-grandfather, were not
succeeded by others of their kind, and the prudent mothers
of England no longer feared to allow their handsome
daughters to enter the precincts of the royal palace. The
English masses were, at first, greatly astonished at the
personal purity of their sovereign, but, after a while, became
reconciled to the belief that a monarch need not,
necessarily, be a libertine.</p>

<p class='c009'>King George evidently borrowed a leaf from the book
of Queen Anne when he assumed the crown. She had assured
her subjects that hers was “an entirely English heart.”
George’s first address from the throne opened with the words,
“Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
Briton.” Coming from a king, this sentiment, addressed to
a people in general so fervidly “loyal” as the English, produced
a most favorable effect, and, to the end of his long
reign, was never forgotten, even when his mule-like obstinacy
wellnigh goaded them to desperation. George III,
from first to last, in his love of domination, impatience of
opposition, carelessness of the rights of other peoples, egotism,
intolerance, and commercial greed, stood for John
Bull. Behind John Bull stood England, very much as she
still stands to-day. The address continued by declaring
that the civil and religious rights of his “loving subjects”
were equally dear to him with the most valuable prerogatives
of the crown. It was his fixed purpose, he said, to
countenance and encourage the practice of true religion and
virtue. The eyes of all Europe, he declared, were on that
Parliament and from it “the <i>Protestant</i> interest hoped for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>protection.” At the end of the speech, King George intimated
that the toleration of the Catholics—that is, connivance
at their existence, particularly in Ireland—would
not be interfered with. But the penal statutes remained
unrepealed, and the Irish Catholics continued to be persecuted,
although rather less brutally, particularly as regarded
their religious observances, in their own country. They
were not allowed to vote, or hold office, or have any say
whatever in public affairs, although they were subject to
taxes and fines. They could not be educated, and were
debarred from practicing any profession under long-established
penalties. In short, they were very little better off
during the earlier years of George III’s reign than under
the sway of his two immediate predecessors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Irish Protestant mind, however, did not lose its patriotic
impulse, because of the interested silence of Malone,
Boyle, and the former leaders of the Patriot party. Members
of Parliament had hitherto been elected to serve during
the life of the sovereign, and, in the beginning of the
reign of George III, the new Irish Parliament began an
earnest agitation for octennial Parliaments. Among the
able men—of them destined to be famous—who were
elected to the new body were Hussey Burgh, Dennis Bowes
Daly, Henry Flood, and Dr. Lucas. It should have been
stated that the original Irish demand was for a seven years’
Parliament, and bills were passed, in 1761 and 1763, embodying
the proposition, but the king and English Privy
Council, to whom they had to be submitted, under the
Poynings’ Act, coolly “pocketed” them, and they were heard
of no more. This arbitrary conduct of an alien monarch,
and advisory body, aroused great public indignation, and the
clamor became so loud, in 1767, that, finally, the bill was returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>from England, changed to octennial, or eight years,
and, with this amendment, it passed the Irish Parliament
and received the royal sanction in February of the succeeding
year. Under the new act, a Parliament was elected in
1768, and all the advocates of the new dispensation were
re-elected. Where all did noble work, it is not detracting
from their merit to remark that Dr. Lucas was the real
leader of the movement, and was generally recognized as
such. He lived only two years after his great triumph, and
was almost universally mourned—the only exceptions being
the members of the corrupt Court party. He was formally
eulogized in the Irish House of Commons, and at his funeral
the pall-bearers were Lord Kildare, Lord Charlemont,
Henry Flood, Sir Lucius O’Brien, Hussey Burgh, and
Speaker Ponsonby.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Patriot party continued, in the new Parliament, under
the administration of Lord Townsend, a vigorous opposition
to unjust pension lists, and other evils which afflicted
the nation. The Lord Lieutenant, who was jolly and persuasive,
also corrupt, attempted to break up the opposition after
the good old English fashion, but made no impression on
the able phalanx led by Flood, who, after the death of Lucas,
was looked upon as the chief of the Patriot element in
the Commons. Kildare, notwithstanding his peculiar action
in the days of Malone, <i>et al.</i>, continued to champion the popular
cause in the House of Peers. Resistance to the supply
bill, which changed the Irish military establishment from
12,000 to 15,000 men, brought about the prorogation of
Parliament session after session for nearly two years.
Meanwhile, the Castle was quietly “seeing” the members,
and, in spite of Flood and Speaker Ponsonby, an address of
confidence, carried by a bare majority, was passed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>Commons. The Speaker refused to present it and resigned
his post. A Mr. Perry was elected to succeed him, and, for
a time, it looked as if the Patriots might be broken up. But
Mr. Perry, in spite of his suspicious conduct in accepting
the speakership, vacated by his friend, Mr. Ponsonby, remained
faithful to Irish interests and the ranks of the opposition
became even more formidable than before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord Townsend, the jolly old corruptionist, became so
unpopular that nearly every public print in Dublin was
filled with lampoons upon him, and, finally, he requested
retirement and was succeeded by Lord Harcourt, in 1772.
He began well, but ended badly, as is usual with English
viceroys in Ireland, who have seldom failed to fall eventually
under Dublin Castle influences. He attempted to throw
unjust burdens on Ireland, but was resisted at every point,
particularly when he sought to make the supply bill extend
over two years instead of one. Henry Flood delivered one
of his best speeches in opposition to this dishonest innovation.
Hussey Burgh promised that if any member in future
brought in such a bill he would move his expulsion. But the
climax was reached when the Hon. George Ogle, of Wexford,
author of the well-known lyric, “Molly Astore,” which
has retained its popularity for more than a century, proposed
that the bill, as introduced, be burned by the hangman.
The Speaker reminded Mr. Ogle that the document was
decorated with the great seal. “Then,” replied the witty
poet, “it will burn all the better!” Mr. Ogle’s suggestion
was not carried out, but the bill was subsequently modified
to suit the ideas of the House of Commons.</p>

    <div>The Peace of Paris—Agrarian Warfare in Ireland—Judicial Murder of Father Sheehy—All who Swore Against Him Die Violent Deaths—Societies</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>THE Peace of Paris, 1763, brought the Seven Years’
War to a conclusion on the Continent of Europe.
Frederick the Great retained Silesia, formerly an Austrian
province, to which he had no just title; and there were
other territorial changes of less importance. England had
triumphed over the French interest in America; for Wolfe’s
victory of the Plains of Abraham, at Quebec, in September,
1759, decided the game of war in favor of the British,
although other battles were fought by the opposing forces
after that event.</p>

<p class='c009'>Agrarian oppression in Ireland, particularly in the South,
had caused the peasantry to organize themselves into secret
societies for mutual protection. It was thus that the famous
“White Boys” of the last century—so-called from
wearing linen shirts, or white woolen jackets, over their
other clothes, so as to give them a uniform appearance—came
into existence. Their methods were crude, wild, often
fierce and sometimes cruel. They defied the law because
they had found no element of protection in it. Rather
had they found it, as administered by the landlord oligarchy,
in whose hands it was placed by the evil genius of England,
an instrument of intolerable oppression. No justice was
to be obtained by any appeal they might make to their tyrants,
and so they resorted to what an Irish orator has
called “the wild justice of revenge.” As usual, some naturally
bad men found their way into these organizations, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>often vented their malice on individuals in the name of the
trampled people. The landlords took advantage of the
commission of crime to get up another “Popish plot” scare,
and succeeded in making shallow and timid people accept
the slander as truth. The real object of the “White Boys”
was to secure low rentals on tillage land, and to preserve
“commonage rights”—that is, grazing lands in common at
a nominal cost, or else free, something that had long been
the usage—for their stock. The landlords, not satisfied
with levying exorbitant rents, and grown, if possible,
harder and more greedy than ever, finally abolished and
fenced in “the commons.” This action aroused the fury of
the peasantry, particularly in the Munster counties, and
they collected in large bodies and demolished the landlords’
fences. This gave the tyrants an excuse to call for
military aid—the argument being that the people were in
arms against “the crown,” which, of course, was false.
The poor peasantry struck at their nearest and most visible
oppressors, and never thought about “the crown.” The
king was, to them, very like a myth. It would seem that
many of the poorer Protestants joined with the Catholics
in the demonstration against the inclosures, which, of course,
showed the absurdity of the “Popish plot” story. Still, the
affair was not to terminate until it begot a cruel tragedy.
The parish priest of Clogheen, County Tipperary, in 1765,
was the Rev. Nicholas Sheehy, a high-minded and saintly
man, whose heart was deeply touched by the sufferings of
the poor tenants, whose ardent and eloquent champion he
became. The Cromwellian “aristocracy” of the county,
headed by the Bagnals, the Maudes, the Bagwells, the
Tolers, and a parson named Hewitson, resolved to get rid
of Father Sheehy, and only waited for a good chance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>insnare him in their toils. Two years previous to the date
already given, they had had the young priest arrested on a
charge of swearing in “White Boys,” but, because of insufficient
evidence, he was acquitted. Soon after he was released,
one Bridge, who had been a principal witness against
him, mysteriously disappeared. The oligarchs had the
priest arrested immediately on a charge of murder. The
witnesses employed to appear against him were a horse-stealer,
named Toohey, a vagrant youth named Lonergan,
and an immoral woman, named Dunlea. He had lain in
Clonmel jail, heavily ironed, for several months before he
was brought to trial. The prosecution did not have their
witnesses fully instructed. At last, March 12, 1765, Father
Sheehy was brought up for trial. He succeeded in proving
an alibi, but that was of no avail. His destruction was determined
upon, and, on March 15, he suffered execution by
hanging and subsequent decapitation. This atrocious murder
aroused the anger of the country. Protestants and
Catholics alike joined in execrating the crime. Yet, he was
not the only victim. In May of the same year, Edward
Sheehy, a cousin, and two other young farmers, were convicted
and hanged on the same testimony that had sent
Father Sheehy to his untimely grave. McGee says: “The
fate of their enemies is notorious; with a single exception,
they met deaths violent, loathsome, and terrible. Maude
died insane, Bagwell in idiocy; one of the jury committed
suicide, another was found dead in a privy, a third was
killed by his horse, a fourth was drowned, a fifth shot, and
so through the entire list. Toohey was hanged for felony,
the prostitute, Dunlea, fell into a cellar and was killed, and
the lad, Lonergan, after enlisting as a soldier, died of a
loathsome disease in a Dublin infirmary.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>Another attempt at persecution of the priests was made
in 1767, but Edmund Burke, the illustrious statesman, and
other liberal Protestants, came to the rescue with funds for
the defence of the accused, and the oligarchy were unable
to secure the conviction of their intended victims. The fate
of the perjured informers, who swore away the lives of
Father Sheehy and his fellow-sufferers, was well known
throughout the country, and, no doubt, had a wholesome
effect on other wretches who might have been bribed into
following their example.</p>

<p class='c009'>The “White Boys” were not the only secret organization
formed in Ireland at that period. Some were composed
of Protestants, mostly of the Presbyterian sect, who
combated in Ulster the exactions of the landlords. They
bore such names as “Hearts of Steel,” because they were
supposed to show no mercy to “the petty tyrants of their
fields”; “Oak Boys,” because they carried oaken boughs, or
wore oak leaves in their hats. The “Peep o’ Day Boys”
were political rather than agrarian, and professed the peculiar
principles afterward adopted by the Orange Association.
They confined themselves mainly to keeping up the
anniversary of the Boyne and making occasional brutal attacks
on defenceless Catholics. The respectable Protestant
element kept scrupulously away from association with these
rude fanatics. The successors of the “White Boys” in
Munster were the equally dreaded “Terry Alts,” who existed
down to a very recent period, and belonged, mainly,
to the County Tipperary. Like the “White Boys,” they
raided the houses of “the gentry” and their retainers for
arms, and severe, often fatal, conflicts resulted from their
midnight visitations. They also killed, from time to time,
obnoxious landlords and their agents, and were hanged by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>the score in retaliation. The government was not over-particular
regarding their guilt or innocence. The object was to
avenge the slain land-grabbers, and also to “strike terror.”
As usual, many base informers were found to betray their
fellows, but, in justice to the “White Boys” and “Terry
Alts,” it may be stated that the betrayers of their secrets
were mostly Castle spies, or detectives, employed for the
purpose of entrapping the unwary. Very few of the regular
members, who lived among their own relatives, accepted
blood money. In many cases, the peasantry committed unnecessary
acts of violence, but, in general, they only visited
with severe punishment landlords or their agents who were
notorious evictors, or farmers who “took the land” over the
heads of the evicted tenants.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Catholic Church was the consistent opponent of the
agrarian organizations, because of the mutual bloodshed
between them and the landlord element, but, much as the
Catholic peasants held their bishops and priests in reverence,
the admonitions of the latter had small effect on the
young men of their flocks while wholesale evictions were in
progress. The “boys,” with rough logic, would say, among
themselves: “The clergy mean well, but we had better be
hanged than starved to death, and, besides, revenge on our
tyrants is sweet.” There is hardly anything in Old World
history more ghastly than the long, desultory, and deadly
war of tenant against landlord in Ireland, from the days of
George II to the latter part of Victoria’s reign. It is a
chapter we gladly turn away from, with the remark that the
cruel oligarchy, who wantonly provoked a naturally humane
people to crime, were infinitely more criminal than the poor,
oppressed peasants they made desperate.</p>

    <div>Flood and Grattan—Sudden Rise of the Latter—Speaks for a Free Commerce—The Volunteer Movement—England Yields to Irish Demand</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_72 c018'>IT was unfortunate for both America and Ireland that
Henry Grattan, who had entered Parliament in December,
1775, had not attained to the leadership of the Patriot
party when the colonies revolted against the tyranny of
George III. Flood held that position when hostilities appeared
imminent, and his influence, somewhat ignorantly
exerted, had much to do with voting 4,000 troops from the
Irish establishment for service against the Americans. At
the time, the American case was not as well understood
in Ireland as it was later on, and, besides, an accommodation
was hoped for. In the course of his speech supporting
the policy of the government, Flood said that the troops
from Ireland were “armed negotiators”—a most unfortunate
phrase, which Grattan, in after days, turned against
him to good effect, when he uttered that fierce philippic
against his quondam friend during an acrimonious debate
which arose soon after the Irish Parliamentary triumph over
England in 1782. It must be remembered by American
readers that the Irish Parliament which voted men to put
down the American revolutionists was Protestant in creed
and mainly English in blood. Not a Catholic sat in it, and
but few men of Celtic origin. The sympathies of the Catholic
and dissenting masses were unmistakably with the
Americans, and Grattan in the Irish Legislature, and Burke
and Brinsley Sheridan in the English House of Commons,
were their eloquent champions. Flood, although a man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>fine intellect and an accomplished orator, soon found himself
rather outclassed by Grattan, who was young, ardent,
and animated by a “pentecostal fire,” which prompted him
to utter some of the most inspiring speeches that ever
flowed from the lips of man. Flood, following the example
of Malone at another period, had accepted office under the
Harcourt administration, and it was openly charged by his
enemies, and probably with some degree of truth, that he
had been influenced in his action against America by the circumstance.
He had also supported the embargo measure,
imposed by order in council, which debarred Irish food
products from exportation to the American colonies in
revolt. Naturally, conduct of this kind produced dissatisfaction
among his friends and followers, and his popularity
immediately declined.</p>

<p class='c009'>The decline of Flood as a Patriot leader left a free field
for Grattan and his best-known competitors for oratorical
honors, Hussey Burgh, Bowes Daly, and Yelverton. At
first, Grattan was rather chary of speech in the House, but,
gradually, he gained confidence in himself, and, although his
gestures were awkward and his elocution generally faulty,
the matter of his addresses was so full of fire, energy, and
logic that he soon became the acknowledged chief of what
Byron happily termed in his “Irish Avatar” the eloquent
war. The restrictions on Irish commerce demanded his first
attention, and his earlier utterances in Parliament were
mostly devoted to that question. It has been erroneously
stated that Henry Grattan was a “free trader” in the American
and British sense of that term. On the contrary, he believed
in a moderate tariff for the protection of Irish industries,
and also for the accumulation of a revenue, and this
was fully exemplified by the action of the Irish Parliament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>when, from 1782 to 1800, it became virtually independent,
in enacting tariff laws for the objects stated. It is true the
tariff in regard to English imports was comparatively low,
but still high enough to give the Irish manufacturer a good
chance to compete with the manufactures of the richer country.
What Grattan and his followers wanted was free commerce—an
exemption from the export duties, which crippled
Irish merchants; and freedom to export Irish goods, without
hindrance from English customs officers, to any country
of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the news of the battle of Saratoga and surrender
of Burgoyne to the American army reached Ireland, in 1777,
it produced a profound impression. Grattan, who always
favored the American cause, moved an address to the throne
in favor of retrenchment, which meant reduction of the military
establishment, while Bowes Daly moved, and had carried,
another address, which deplored the continuance of
the American war, but professed fidelity to the royal person.
As usual, when England got the worst of it abroad, small
concessions were made to the Irish Catholics, and the Irish
Parliament was permitted to pass a bill “authorizing Papists
to loan money on mortgages, to lease lands for any period
not exceeding 999 years, and to inherit and bequeath real
property.” This bill had “a rider” which abolished the test
oath as regarded the Dissenters, and, no doubt, this provision
had much to do with the success of the bill as a whole,
which did not, however, pass without strenuous opposition.</p>

<p class='c009'>An attempt made by Lord Nugent in the English Parliament
to mitigate the severity of the navigation and embargo
acts, as regarded Ireland, was howled down by the English
manufacturers, merchants, and tradespeople generally. The
knowledge of this action spurred on Grattan and his followers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>and, thenceforward, “Free Trade” became their rallying
cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>Protestant Ireland, since the year of Thurot’s bold exploit,
had lived in much terror of another French invasion,
on a larger scale. When France, in 1778, became the ally
of the United States of America, which had declared their
independence on July 4, 1776, this feeling of alarm increased.
Their leaders demanded military protection from
the government, and were informed that the latter had none
to give, unless they would accept invalids and dismounted
cavalrymen. Henry Flood, seconded by Speaker Perry, had
long advocated the formation of a national militia, and these
gentlemen were cordially supported in the proposition by
Grattan, Lord Charlemont, and other noted leaders of the
Patriot party. A bill authorizing a volunteer militia passed
the Irish Parliament in 1778. After a great deal of discussion,
it was deemed more prudent to form the force from independent
organizations of volunteers, armed by the state,
but clothed and otherwise equipped by themselves. They
were left free to elect their own officers. Immediately, a
patriotic impulse permeated the nation, and the Protestant
Irish, who were alone permitted to bear arms, rallied to the
armories and parade-grounds by the thousand. Belfast and
Strabane claimed the honor of having formed the first companies.
The richer among the Catholics supplied money to
the poor among their Protestant neighbors for the purchase
of uniforms and other necessaries. This patriotic action on
their part naturally resulted in an immediate mitigation of
the penal discrimination against them and the entrance of
hundreds of them into the ranks of the volunteers was, at
first, connived at, and soon openly permitted. The result
was that, by the spring of 1780, there were, at least, 65,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>men under arms for Ireland in her four provinces—Ulster
leading in numbers and enthusiasm. The rank and file
were artisans, farmers, and clerks, while the officers were,
in general, selected from among the wealthy and aristocratic
classes. Many of these officers equipped their companies, or
regiments, at their own expense. The Earl of Charlemont—a
weak but well-meaning nobleman—was elected commander
by the Ulster volunteers, while the amiable Duke of
Leinster—the second of that proud title—was chosen by
those of Leinster. Munster and Connaught, not being quite
as well organized as their sister provinces, deferred their
selections. All English goods were tabooed by the volunteers,
their families, and friends, and a favorite maxim of
the period was that of Dean Swift, already quoted, “Burn
everything coming from England, except the coal!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The now feeble shadow of English government, holding
court at Dublin Castle, viewed this formidable uprising
with genuine alarm, and did its utmost to prevent the issuance
of arms to the volunteers, but the Irish leaders were
not to be cajoled or baffled, and, in the summer of 1779,
the new Irish army was thoroughly armed, drilled and
ready for any service that might be demanded from it.
The leaders had now the weapon to enforce their rights in
hand, and did not fail to make good use of it. They met
and formed plans for the coming session of Parliament,
and were delighted to receive assurances from Flood, and
other officeholders, that they would support Grattan and
his allies in the demand that Irish commerce have “free
export and import.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An address, covering the points stated, with the amendment
“free trade” substituted by Flood for the original
phrase, passed the Houses, when they met, and on the succeeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>day the House of Commons, with the Speaker at
its head, proceeded to the Castle and presented the address
to the viceroy. The volunteers, commanded by the Duke
of Leinster, occupied both sides of the streets through which
the members had to pass and presented arms to the nation’s
representatives, many of whom wore the diversified uniforms
of the Patriot army. Dublin, in all its varied
history, never witnessed a grander or more inspiring
spectacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Alderman Horan, of Dublin, precipitated a crisis by demanding
freedom of export for some Irish woolens to
Amsterdam, and he filed his demand, in due form, at the
custom house. This was in defiance of the prohibitory enactment
of the reign of William III and an English man-of-war
was stationed in Dublin Bay to enforce it. Mr.
Horan, not being provided with a battleship, was fain to
content himself with leaving his demand on file, but he had
gained his point by directing public attention to an insulting
grievance with a stern object lesson. Ireland saw, at
once, that English monopoly would yield nothing, except to
force, or the threat of force. Henry Grattan, in the Commons,
replied to the shotted guns of the English frigate
in the bay by introducing an amendment to the supply
bill, which declared that “at this time, it is inexpedient
to grant new taxes.” This was carried overwhelmingly,
and England began to think that, after all, Irish votes were
a match for English guns. Grattan gained a further triumph
over the government by causing the defeat of a bill providing
duties for the support of the loan fund.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lord North, when confronted with the ominous news
from Ireland, remembering his unfortunate experience with
the American patriots, determined to back down from his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>former despotic position. He brought in resolutions which
gave Ireland the right to trade with British colonies in
America and Africa, and granted free export to glass and
woolens. The Irish Parliament adopted similar resolutions,
and the main portion of Ireland’s commercial grievances
was, thereby, removed.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
